    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><br /><hr />THIS BEGINS A NEW PRACTICE</B></P>
    <P>This begins a new practice of weekly dispatches of Knowledge from Guruji. Every center around the world will receive the Knowledge so it can be read for people to copy down at weekly Satsang. Here is the first segment Guruji dictated at Big Sur, 21 June, 1995.</P>
    <P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * *</P>
    <P>Beyond an event is Knowledge.&#9;</P>
    <P>Beyond a person is love.</P>
    <P>Beyond an object is infinity.</P>
    <P>Knowledge is not in an event; it is beyond an event.</P>
    <P>If you take one event and infer anything from one event -- infer knowledge -- it will be erroneous knowledge. Say Nancy gets angry and shouts at someone. You attribute anger to Nancy, but actually it was carried from someone else to her. Someone else got angry first and someone else and someone else and on and on like that.</P>
    <P>When you go beyond an event, only then the truth dawns. One particular event gives you a false notion. So you have to consider the totality of events, the totality of all events infinitely. Beyond the event is Knowledge.</P>
    <P>What do we call a person? A person is a body, a mind, a complex of behaviors which is changing. Love is unchanging. Beyond the person is love.</P>
    <P>When you lose your personality, you become love. If you cannot lose yourself, you cannot find yourself. So, lose your personality; you'll find yourself!!!</P>
    <P>Behind every object is infinity. An object is limited. Take an object and reduce, reduce, reduce, and you have an atom. An atom is infinity. Each atom contains infinite space. Beyond the object is infinity.</P>
    <P>The object behind the object is infinity. The person behind the person is love.</P>
    <P>Maya is getting caught up in the event, personality, object. Knowledge, love, Brahman is seeing beyond the event, personality, or object. See? Just a little shift.</P>

  	<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><br /><hr />CLOSE TO THE MASTER</B></P>
    <P>If you're not feeling close to the Guru, it's because of you. Because of your mind, because of your ego concepts. Share with the Guru that which is very important or intimate to you. Share that. Do not feel shame, shy, or judgmental about yourself. </P>
    <P>Unless you express to the Master that which is very intimate and important to you, just being on the formal and informal communication levels cannot make you feel close. "How are you, where are you going? How have you been?" Stop formal and superficial conversations with the Master and speak with your heart that which is very important and intimate, very deep to your life. Don't just say how much the squash costs, 30 cents or whatever.</P>
    <P>If you don't feel close to the Master, there's no point in having a Master. It is just another burden to you. You have enough already. Just say "Goodbye," get rid of it.</P>
    <P>Question: When you play little games and push us away, how can we feel close to you?</P>
    <P>Answer: You should feel more close if you are pushed away, scolded or ignored. Because to ignore somebody takes a lot of effort. When a Master does not even ignore wrapping paper, or a flower that is in a vase, how can he ignore a walking, talking, breathing human being who is connected? How could that be ignored? So when you understand this, you already feel close.</P>
    <P>Question: Can we call you every week?</P>
    <P>Response from the room: Call Guruji every week and if he doesn't answer the phone then you know you are loved.</P>
    <P>Answer: Yes, put that in. &#9;(Laughter)</P>
    <P>You are with the Master to share the joy of the Master, to share the consciousness of the Master. For that, you have to empty your cup of what is already in it. So you share that with the Master. You share whatever you have and don't judge, "Oh, that is garbage." The Master is ready to accept any garbage of any extent. However you are, he will embrace you. He is ready to share. You only have to share from your side.</P>

  	<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><br /><hr />PRABDHA KARMA AND SANCHITA KARMA</B></P>
    <P>Some karma can be changed and some cannot.</P>
    <P>When you prepare halwa, if sugar is less or ghee is less, water more or less, it can all be adjusted, repaired. But once soji is cooked, it cannot be reversed.</P>
    <P>If the buttermilk is sour, milk can be added, salt can be added to make it drinkable. But it can never be reversed back to milk.</P>
    <P>Prabdha karma cannot be changed. Sanchita karma can be changed by spiritual practices. Satsang burns the seed of all negative karma.</P>
    <P>When you praise someone, you take on their good karma. When you blame someone you take on their bad karma.</P>
    <P>Know this and surrender both good and bad karma to the Divine and be free.</P>
