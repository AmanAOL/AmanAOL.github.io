    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>THIS BEGINS A NEW PRACTICE</B></P>
    <P>This begins a new practice of weekly dispatches of Knowledge from Guruji. Every center around the world will receive the Knowledge so it can be read for people to copy down at weekly Satsang. Here is the first segment Guruji dictated at Big Sur, 21 June, 1995.</P>
    <P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * *</P>
    <P>Beyond an event is Knowledge.&#9;</P>
    <P>Beyond a person is love.</P>
    <P>Beyond an object is infinity.</P>
    <P>Knowledge is not in an event; it is beyond an event.</P>
    <P>If you take one event and infer anything from one event -- infer knowledge -- it will be erroneous knowledge. Say Nancy gets angry and shouts at someone. You attribute anger to Nancy, but actually it was carried from someone else to her. Someone else got angry first and someone else and someone else and on and on like that.</P>
    <P>When you go beyond an event, only then the truth dawns. One particular event gives you a false notion. So you have to consider the totality of events, the totality of all events infinitely. Beyond the event is Knowledge.</P>
    <P>What do we call a person? A person is a body, a mind, a complex of behaviors which is changing. Love is unchanging. Beyond the person is love.</P>
    <P>When you lose your personality, you become love. If you cannot lose yourself, you cannot find yourself. So, lose your personality; you'll find yourself!!!</P>
    <P>Behind every object is infinity. An object is limited. Take an object and reduce, reduce, reduce, and you have an atom. An atom is infinity. Each atom contains infinite space. Beyond the object is infinity.</P>
    <P>The object behind the object is infinity. The person behind the person is love.</P>
    <P>Maya is getting caught up in the event, personality, object. Knowledge, love, Brahman is seeing beyond the event, personality, or object. See? Just a little shift.</P>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>CLOSE TO THE MASTER</B></P>
    <P>If you're not feeling close to the Guru, it's because of you. Because of your mind, because of your ego concepts. Share with the Guru that which is very important or intimate to you. Share that. Do not feel shame, shy, or judgmental about yourself. </P>
    <P>Unless you express to the Master that which is very intimate and important to you, just being on the formal and informal communication levels cannot make you feel close. "How are you, where are you going? How have you been?" Stop formal and superficial conversations with the Master and speak with your heart that which is very important and intimate, very deep to your life. Don't just say how much the squash costs, 30 cents or whatever.</P>
    <P>If you don't feel close to the Master, there's no point in having a Master. It is just another burden to you. You have enough already. Just say "Goodbye," get rid of it.</P>
    <P>Question: When you play little games and push us away, how can we feel close to you?</P>
    <P>Answer: You should feel more close if you are pushed away, scolded or ignored. Because to ignore somebody takes a lot of effort. When a Master does not even ignore wrapping paper, or a flower that is in a vase, how can he ignore a walking, talking, breathing human being who is connected? How could that be ignored? So when you understand this, you already feel close.</P>
    <P>Question: Can we call you every week?</P>
    <P>Response from the room: Call Guruji every week and if he doesn't answer the phone then you know you are loved.</P>
    <P>Answer: Yes, put that in. &#9;(Laughter)</P>
    <P>You are with the Master to share the joy of the Master, to share the consciousness of the Master. For that, you have to empty your cup of what is already in it. So you share that with the Master. You share whatever you have and don't judge, "Oh, that is garbage." The Master is ready to accept any garbage of any extent. However you are, he will embrace you. He is ready to share. You only have to share from your side.</P>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>PRABDHA KARMA AND SANCHITA KARMA</B></P>
    
    <P>Some karma can be changed and some cannot.</P>
    <P>When you prepare halwa, if sugar is less or ghee is less, water more or less, it can all be adjusted, repaired. But once soji is cooked, it cannot be reversed.</P>
    <P>If the buttermilk is sour, milk can be added, salt can be added to make it drinkable. But it can never be reversed back to milk.</P>
    <P>Prabdha karma cannot be changed. Sanchita karma can be changed by spiritual practices. Satsang burns the seed of all negative karma.</P>
    <P>When you praise someone, you take on their good karma. When you blame someone you take on their bad karma.</P>
    <P>Know this and surrender both good and bad karma to the Divine and be free.</P>

    <font face=arial,helvetica size=2 >
   
    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>ONLY SPEAK KNOWLEDGE</B></P>
<P>Only speak Knowledge. Don't repeat anything that someone tells you or opinions about anyone that someone states -- "That so-and-so said such-and-such about you." If someone comes to tell you such things, discourage them. Don't believe it. </P>
<P>If someone blames you directly, know that they are taking away your bad karma and let it go. Don't believe in it, and if you're one of the Guru's close ones, you will take all of the blame of the world with a smile. </P>
<P>Conflict is the nature of the world; comfort is the nature of the self. Amidst the conflict seek the comfort. </P>
<P>When you are bored with the comfort, get into the games of the world. When you are tired of the games of the world, get into the comforts of the Self. If you are one of the Guru's close ones, you do both simultaneously. Trying to end conflict prolongs it. Face the conflict by seeking the comfort of the Self. </P>
<P>God is alive in the world and has been putting up with all the ongoing conflicts throughout the ages. If God can put up with all the conflicts, you can too. The moment you agree to be with the conflict, the conflict disappears.</P>
<P>People who love peace do not want to fight, and those who fight do not love peace. Those who want peace want to run away. What is needed here is to be peaceful within and then fight. The whole message of the Gita is to be peaceful yourself and then fight. Krishna tells Arjuna to fight but be in peace at the same time. Does this ring a bell?</P>
<P>In the world, you resolve one conflict and another one comes up. For example, Russia is solved and then Bosnia arises. You make one better, and then another starts up. Your body gets a cold, then you get better; then your back hurts, then it gets better. Your body gets better, and then the mind goes. The world runs like this, isn't it?</P>
<P>Without any intention, misunderstandings happen. It's not up to you to try to resolve them. Ignore them and be alive.</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>MASTER IS A DOORWAY</B></P>
      <P>Master is a doorway. And the doorway needs to be more charming than the world so that you will come to the doorway. Someone is in the street and there is rain, thunder, hot sun; they need shelter. They look around, they find a doorway. They come to the doorway. The doorway is more inviting, more charming, more celebrative, more joyful than anything else in the world.</P>
      <P>Nothing could give that much peace, joy, pleasure in the world. Once you come to the doorway, you enter the door and see the world from there. See the world from the eyes of the Master. This is a sign that you have come to the Master. Otherwise you may still be standing in the street and looking at the door. </P>
      <P>But once you have entered the door, then you will see the whole world from the eyes of the Master. This means what? In every situation that you face, you will think, "If this situation comes in front of the Master, how would he handle it?" or "How would she handle it?" "If this complication comes in front of the Master, how would he take it?" "If someone blames the Master like this, how would he handle it?" See the world from the eyes of the Master all the time.</P>
      <P>The world looks much more beautiful; not a nasty place. But a place filled with love, filled with joy, cooperation, compassion, and all virtues. The world is much more fun. Looking through the doorway, there is no fear. You will look at the world without any fear. You will be in all relationships with everybody without any fear. Because there is shelter. </P>
      <P>From inside home, you will look at the thunder, you will look at the storm, you will look at the rain, you will look at the bright sun. Inside you have air conditioning. Very cool, pleasant. Outside it's hot. You donÒ´ mind because there is nothing that can really distract you, disturb you, or take the fullness away from you. Such a sense of security, such a sense of fullness and joy comes. That is the purpose of having a Master.</P>
      <P>All relationships in the world go topsy-turvy. You make relationships and you break relationships. All relationships can get broken or made up and again broken. And there is craving and aversion. This is the world. This is samsara.</P>
      <P>But the Master is not a relationship. The Master is the Presence. What is necessary is to feel the Presence of the Master, not to make a relationship. Don't make the Master a part of your world. Then the same, "Oh, he looked at me." "He didn't look at me." "Oh, he said this." "He didn't say that." "Oh, somebody is close. I am not close." All this garbage comes into it. You feel the Presence of the Master, that is eternal. That has been there with you before, now, and will be there in the future, too.</P>
      <P>Master is the Presence. World is relativity. And relativity has limitations. Presence is unlimited. Presence is vast, infinite, and all comprehensive, all inclusive. And the presence of the Master in one's life will bring fulfillment to all relations. Every relationship will become complete with the presence of the Infinity if the Master is in your life. </P>

Accepting it either as black or as white. Put it either as black and accept it or as white and accept it -- whether or not it is black or white. And see the gray as a shade of black or white. Either way you accept it. Honest or dishonest -- accept it. Then the mind is quiet. You are not in the gray area.</P>
      <P>See, the eyes are dark, eyebrows are dark, the thymus -- the most powerful organ of the body -- is black. Hemoglobin -- the main force of the body -- is black. You cannot survive without black. It is part of you.</P>
      <P>Or see it as white. Eye is also white. Bones are white; the structure on which the whole body stands is white. Put it in a category of black -- no problem -- accept. Put it in a category of white -- no problem -- doubt is not there. Have conviction. "I accept. They are dishonest and still part of me." That's it. Finished.</P>
      <P>Doubt is wanting to get rid of something. Doubt is a temporary state. Neither up nor below. There tension arises.</P>

        </B><P>&nbsp;The senses are like fire. Your life is also like fire. In the fire of senses, whatever you put in burns. If you burn tires, it creates pollution and bad smell. But if you burn sandalwood, it creates fragrance. </P>
        <P>&nbsp;Celebration happens around the bonfire. Grief happens around the fire of cremation. The same fire that supports life in winter, can also destroy. One fire, like a ghee lamp, lights your way and purifies. Another fire made of toxic material creates pollution. </P>
        <P>&nbsp;You are also like fire. Are you the fire that creates smoke and pollution or the flame of camphor which creates light and fragrance? A saint is like a camphor flame that creates light and the fragrance of love. He is the friend of life.</P>
        <P>&nbsp;The fire that creates light and warmth and is useful is of higher quality. The fire that creates light and a little smoke as well is of medium quality. The fire that creates darkness and only smoke is of low quality. Learn to distinguish the different fires. If your senses are engaged in goodness, then you will create light and fragrance. If engaged in impurity, you create smoke and darkness. It is <I>samyama</I> that transforms the quality of fire in you. Next week we will discuss <I>samyama</I>. </P>

            <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>HABITS AND VOWS</B></P>
          </B><P>&nbsp;How to get rid of <I>vasanas</I> (impressions)? This is a question for all those who want to come out of habits. </P>
          <P>&nbsp;You want to get rid of habits because they give pain and restrict you. The nature of <I>vasana</I> is to bother you, or bind you, and wanting to be free is the nature of life. Life wants to be free and when a soul doesn't know how to be free, it wanders through lifetimes wanting freedom.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;The way to come out of habits is vows. This is <I>samyama</I>. Everybody is endowed with a little <I>samyama</I>. </P>
          <P>&nbsp;A vow should be time bound. This would bring good conduct and save you from being wayward. Consider the time and place for vows to be taken.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;When the mind dwells on useless thoughts, then two things happen. One is that all those old patterns come up and you feel discouraged by them. You blame yourself and feel that you have not made any progress. </P>
          <P>&nbsp;The second thing is that you see it as an opportunity for <I>samyama</I> and feel happy about it. Without <I>samyama,</I> life will not be happy and diseases arise. For example, you know you should not eat three servings of ice cream, or eat ice cream every day, or otherwise you will get sick.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;Habits will clog you when there is no liveliness or juice in life. When there is a direction for life force, you can rise above habits through <I>samyama.</P>
          </I><P>&nbsp;Take vows according to time and place. For example, suppose someone has a habit of smoking cigarettes and says, "I will quit smoking," but cannot do it. They can take a vow, three months or 90 days; a time-bound vow. If someone is used to cursing and swearing, take a vow not to use bad language for ten days. Don't take it for a lifetime; you will break it immediately. If you happen to break it in between, don't worry. Just begin again. Slowly increase the duration until it becomes your nature.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;All those habits which bother you, bind them in vows, in <I>samyama</I>. So all those who are in Satsang, take a time-bound vow today and make a note of it. If you break a vow, make a note of it and share the time and date at the next Satsang. Continue it again. Tie those habits which bring you pain in <I>samyama</I>.</P>

            </B><P>&nbsp;How to get rid of <I>vasanas</I> (impressions)? This is a question for all those who want to come out of habits. </P>
          </B><P>&nbsp;When someone blames you, what do you usually do? Blame them back or you put up resistance in yourself. When someone blames you, they actually take away some negative karma from you. If you understand this and don't put up resistance and feel happy about it, then you drop your resistance. "Oh, good. That person is blaming me. Good. Something is going away." And when you drop the resistance, your karma goes away. Do you see what I'm saying? </P>
          <P>&nbsp;So when someone blames you and you put up resistance in your mind, and you don't react, then you are not allowing them to take the negative karma. Outside you may resist, but inside if you don't resist, and feel happy, "Oh, good, somebody is there to blame me and take some negative karma," you will feel immediately lighter.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;How does it feel to you when someone blames you? Do you feel some heaviness? Usually, when someone blames you, you feel hurt and you feel unhappy, you feel sad. This is all because you're . . . resisting. That is it. What you resist, persists. The ignorant person tells someone, "Don't blame me because it hurts me."</P>
          <P>&nbsp;An enlightened person also says "Don't blame me." Do you know why? Because it might hurt you. This is a beautiful point. What are the points? You get hurt because you resist the blame. When someone blames you, you resist it inside. Outside you may not resist, but inside when you resist, then that hurts you.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;An ignorant person warns you, "You better not hurt me, you better not blame me because I will feel hurt." Someone warns you not to blame them because it will hurt them and they'll do something harmful to you out of revenge.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;An enlightened person says "Don't blame me because it will hurt you." So here you say, don't blame because of compassion. You can tell someone, don't blame me out of compassion, or you can say it out of anger.</P>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>TODAY IS KRISHNA'S BIRTHDAY</B></P>
    <P ALIGN="CENTER">&#9;&#9;BIRTH OF THE CENTER OF ATTRACTION</P>
  </B><P>&nbsp;Krishna means the most attractive . . . It is the divinity that is the most attractive; the energy that pulls everything to it. Krishna is the formless center which is everywhere. Any attraction from anywhere is coming only from Krishna. Often people fail to see the spirit behind the attraction and merely hold on to the outer shell. And the moment you try to possess the shell, you will see Krishna has played a trick and you will be left with an empty shell in your hands and tears in your eyes.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;Be clever like Radha -- don't be tricked by Krishna. Krishna could not escape from Radha, for her whole world was filled with Krishna. If you can see that wherever there is an attraction, there is Krishna; then you are Radha, you are in your center.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;The mind moves towards beauty, joy and truth. Krishna tells Arjuna, "I am the beauty in the Beautiful, the strength in the Strong, the wisdom in the Wise." In this way he arrests the mind from moving away from him.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;Krishna reveals this Knowledge to Arjuna because he is <I>Anasuya</I>. Next week we will see what is <I>Anasuya</I>.</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>ANASUYA</B></P>
    </B><P>&nbsp;Knowledge will be different at different levels of consciousness. At a particular level of consciousness you will become <I>anasuya</I>. <I>Anasuya</I> is devoid of fault-finding eyes. If a mirror is dusty, you need a duster to clean it. But if your eyes have a cataract, any amount of dusting will not help. So first you have to remove the cataract. Then you can see that the mirror is already clean.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;There is a certain mind set that always finds fault, even in the best conditions in the world. When you give a person with this mind set the best, they still find faults. Even with the best possible companion, or the most beautiful painting, they will still find something wrong. That kind of mind set cannot know the sacred Knowledge. Krishna tells Arjuna that he is giving him the Royal Secret, because he is <I>anasuya</I>. "You are not finding fault in Me, even though you are so close."</P>
    <P>&nbsp;From a distance, even craters cannot be seen. Even on a smooth surface there will be holes. If you are only interested in the holes, you will not see the magnanimity of things. If you are not in <I>anasuya</I>, Knowledge cannot blossom in you. Then there is no point in giving Knowledge. </P>
    <P>&nbsp;Question: What about discrimination -- Wisdom?</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Answer: If it is in your vision, your vision will find discrimination. The moment you are out of the path, everything is all wrong, that is not <I>anasuya</I>. For example, you have a friendship, and after 10 years you decide to leave. When you leave, you do not see the good in that relationship. You find fault. This is not <I>anasuya</I>.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;However, once you discover you have the wrong vision, half of the wrong vision has already disappeared. There is a fine line here. There cannot be any better example than the cataract. Instead of saying, "My vision is blurred," you say, "The whole world is not sharp." Suppose someone is coming in. It is windy, so you shut the door. But the person thinks the door has been slammed in his face! This is <I>asuya</I>. It is not <I>anasuya</I>. Most of the population is like this.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;<I>Asuya</I> is finding fault. It is seeing malicious intent everywhere. It is like a child who says, "Mother, you don't love me!" The child's vision is wrong. If the mother does not love the child, who will? It is the same as if someone comes and says, "Guruji, you don't love me!" If I don't love them, forget about it. Nobody else in the world will! Where else will they find love? Nowhere. A mother may get frustrated but not a Master.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Question: It seems as though you can't have <I>anasuya</I> unless you are enlightened?</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Answer: Not always. This is an excuse. To get enlightenment, you must have this vision.</P>

        <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>THE LOVE OF THE IGNORANT AND THE ANGER OF THE ENLIGHTENED</B></P>
      </B><P>&nbsp;The love of the ignorant can be harmful yet even the anger of the Enlightened is not harmful. It can be only good!</P>
      <P>&nbsp;An example is the school at the Art of Living Ashram in Bangalore. 250 children are enrolled but only 200 come to class on any given day. Fifty children don't show up. Why? They cry at home, "Mother, I don't want to go to school."</P>
      <P>&nbsp;The mother says, "Oh, la la, don't cry . . . ok." She thinks, "No child in the world is like my child." And so she sticks up for the child and begins to speak for him. She does not see the teacher's point of view. The mother asks the teacher, "Why are you not teaching my child properly? He is so innocent, so lovely." So, what happens -- the child grows up spoiled. The love in the mother's ignorance has spoiled the child. The child will never learn the alphabet, never learn to read or write, but the mother says, "Oh, never mind, there are sheep to look after and fields to tend." The mother's love in ignorance has spoiled the child.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;The anger of the Enlightened is a blessing. There are many instances of this in the <I>Puranas</I>. Once a Master was traveling in the middle province of India with a disciple following him a few yards behind. Some boys who were rude, rough, and abusive began to throw stones and tease the disciple calling him names. This went on for some time as the boys followed the Master and the disciple. They came to a river. The Master and the disciple got into a boat in order to cross. The boys got in another boat which started to sink in the middle of the river.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;The Master slapped the disciple across the face. The disciple was so surprised as he had not said a word back to the boys in response to their taunts. He had been such a good disciple and yet the Master had slapped him!</P>
      <P>&nbsp;The Master said, "It is your fault. You are responsible for their boat sinking. You did not respond to their abuse. Nature has now punished them in a worse way because you did not have enough compassion to quell their insults."</P>
      <P>&nbsp;The slap that the Master gave took away the karma of this event such that it would not be carried into the future of the boys. It also served to take away any little bit of joy the disciple may have felt at seeing the boys' boat sink! Thus, it also took away the karma of the event for the disciple. So, the anger of the Enlightened is a blessing!</P>

  <P>&nbsp;Every atom of Big Mind is crammed with Knowledge. Knowing this, you stop seeking. You seek until you come to the Master. You walk until you come to the swimming pool. You don't walk or run in the swimming pool -- you swim or float. Once you come to the Master, seeking stops, blossoming begins.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;You are Knowledge. Every atom in you is shimmering with Knowledge. This is called <I>Go</I>. Be a <I>Go-Pal</I>. Be a friend in Knowledge.</P>

  <P>&#9;Complaining</P>
  <P>&#9;Similar cravings or aversions</P>

  <P>Coming together in Knowledge is rare. You become friends because you have something in common. Be a friend in Knowledge. Uplift each other in Knowledge.

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>FREEDOM AND DISCIPLINE</B></P>
  </B><P>Freedom and discipline are opposites and complementary. The purpose of defense is to protect freedom. But is there freedom in defense? Do soldiers have freedom? No, they are totally bound, not even allowed to put the right foot down when told the left foot. Their steps are measured and they are unable even to walk with a natural rhythm. There is total lack of freedom in defense. That which has absolutely no freedom is protecting the freedom of the country! So it is with the police; they protect the freedom of the individual. But are they free?</P>
  <P>Discipline protects freedom. They both go hand in hand. Understand this and go ahead in life. You have some restrictions and it is this that allows you freedom. You can choose to focus either on freedom or discipline, and this makes you happy or unhappy. Freedom without discipline is like a country without a defense.</P>
  <P>Fences should be fences; a fence cannot be built all over the property. If your fence is all over, how can you build on the property? That state of high absolute freedom is too difficult; we need to be very practical. Yes, there is a state of unlimited bliss, the freedom Advaita talks about. The Advaita Knowledge has been totally misused or used according to one's own fancies and conveniences.</P>
  <P>There must be awareness in the mind, love in the heart, and righteousness in action.</P>
  <P>Love and fear are two possibilities that put you on track. The Jewish religion put fear as the main thing so that life could improve. Nature induces fear at a certain age in a child. When a child is very young, it gets 100 percent time and love of the mother. The child has no fear. As the child grows more independent it becomes cautious. Nature brings in an iota of fear. With freedom, the child starts walking carefully. Fear of losing freedom also brings defense. The purpose of defense is to eliminate fear.</P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>On this path Knowledge is your Freedom<BR>and also your Defense.</B></P>

    <P>&nbsp;Knowledge has an end. Knowledge completes. So also does discipleship. For the disciple is aimed at acquiring Knowledge.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Once you cross the water, however nice the boat is, you get off the boat. After twelve years, the disciple completes his studies.

    <P>&nbsp;<I>Sakha</I> is a companion in life and death; it never ends. In the path of love there is neither beginning nor end. <I>Sakha</I> only wants the beloved. He doesn't care about the Knowledge or liberation. Love is incomplete because of longing. And so it is infinite, for infinity can never be complete.</P>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>SAKHA -- YOUR RELIABLE SENSE</B></P>
    
  <P>&nbsp;There are three things: the Self, the senses, and the object, or the world. And there are three words: <I>sukha</I>, pleasure; <I>dukha</I>, sorrow; and <I>sakha</I>, companion. These have one thing in common: "kha," which means "senses."</P>
  <P>&nbsp;The Self through the senses experiences the world. When the senses are with the Self, that is pleasure (<I>sukha</I>), because the Self is the source of all joy or pleasure. When the senses are away from the Self (<I>dukha</I>) -- in the mud, lost in the object -- that is misery. Mud, misery, mind -- they are very close.</P>
  </FONT><FONT FACE="BernhardMod BT" SIZE=5><P>Self &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senses ("Kha")&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; World</P>
  <P>---&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy (Sukha)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorrow (Dukha)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--- </P>
  </FONT><FONT FACE="BernhardMod BT"><P>Self is the nature of joy. In any pleasant experience, you close your eyes; you smell a nice flower, or you taste or touch something. So<I> sukha</I> is that which takes you to the Self. <I>Dukha</I> is that which takes you away from the Self. Sorrow simply means that you are caught up in the object, which goes on changing, instead of focussing on the Self.</P>
  <P>All the sense objects are just a diving board to take you back to the Self.</P>
  <I><P>Sa-kha</I>, companion, means: "He <B><I>is</B></I> the senses." <I>Sakha</I> is one who has become your senses, who is your senses. If you are my senses, it means I get Knowledge through you; you are my sixth sense. As I trust my mind, so I trust you. A friend could be just an object of the senses, but a <I>sakha</I> has become the very senses.</P>
  <P>The <I>sakha</I> is the companion who is there in both the experiences of the <I>dukha</I> and of <I>sukha</I>. It means one who leads you back to the Self. If you are stuck in an object, that wisdom which pulls you back to the Self is <I>sakha</I>.</P>
  <P>Knowledge is your companion and your companion is Knowledge. And the Master is nothing but the embodiment of Knowledge. So<I> sakha</I> means, "He is my senses, I see the world through that wisdom, through Him."</P>
  <P>If your sense is the Divine, then you see the whole world through the Divinity.</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>SCEPTICISM</B></P>
      
      <P>&nbsp;Ignorance is being a sceptic and not knowing you are a sceptic. If you think you are a sceptic, you are no longer a sceptic because you have a clue of something beyond. So, in reality, you can never know whether you are a sceptic or not!</P>
      <P>&nbsp;A sceptic is stuck in a paradigm and closes all other possibilities. But this creation is of all possibilities. As one understands the paradigm shift, scepticism is removed.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;A real scientist can never afford to be a sceptic because scepticism closes down possibilities and does not continue to probe into unknown areas of existence. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;In short, scepticism is an "I know it all" attitude, and this attitude is unscientific. Scepticism is dispelled by Knowledge. Perception and inference are two means of knowing.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;In every human being deep inside, there is faith and love. What you think is scepticism is only a thin layer. If you hold in your mind that they are sceptics you empower their scepticism. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;Do not recognize someone's scepticism and try to argue with them. Argument strengthens their scepticism. Fear of interference in one's freedom brings more resistance and causes scepticism.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;Your silence and the smile from your heart will dispel their scepticism. There is nothing better than silence to break scepticism. Silence means the quality of consciousness, not just keeping lips tight.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;Scepticism doesn't come up in children. It comes only with people who walk with boundaries. Children have no scepticism. They live in their fantasy world, a world of many possibilities. Their world is one of innocence, joy, beauty, and so much love.</P>

        <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>SHAUCHA AND ASHAUCHA</B></P>
        
        <P>&nbsp;When you are miserable, what has happened is that you have gone away from the Self. This is called <I>Ashaucha</I>. It means you have become unclean.</P>
<P>&nbsp;In India when someone dies, the close relatives are said to be <I>Ashaucha</I> for 10 days because they are very sad. They are impure because they have moved away from the self. After 10 days of just being with that experience and reading the Gita, being with the Knowledge and pulling themselves back into the Self, then it is called <I>Shaucha</I>. They have purged out the impurities that have come during events.</P>
<P>&nbsp;This keeps happening again and again in dealings in life. You become <I>Ashaucha</I> and you have to get back to<I> Shaucha</I>. Go deeper in to yourself, then real <I>Shaucha</I> happens.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<I>Shaucha's</I> benefits are clarity in the intellect, a pleasing mind, focused awareness in the mind, a say over the senses, and therefore eligibility to realize the Self.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<I>Shaucha</I> is disinterestedness in the tendencies of one's own senses and non-association with other people. If a tendency in your body arises just have the understanding, "Oh yes, here is this old familiar tendency coming up again. Come on, you have had this experience enough, and still the body is craving for it again." Disinterestedness in one's own body -- just an idea, a sort of distaste, and in one moment it changes.</P>
<P>Why do people love each other so much, have such an intimate relationship, and then fight? <I>Ashaucha</I> has happened. If you don't get distaste for the tendency of the senses then distaste for the object of the senses will come and you will blame the object.</P>
<P>&nbsp;When <I>Ashaucha</I> happens then come back to <I>Shaucha</I> quickly. Suppose you get drowned in any worldly aspect, just know this is <I>Ashaucha</I> . . . "That is why I am suffering misery." Then come back to <I>Shaucha</I>.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Your attraction or craving is only as long as you think someone is "other." When you think they are part of you or your Self, then the attraction dies out. That is why a husband or wife is not attracted to the partner but to someone else because the partner has already become a part of them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;When you realize everyone is part of your Self, you enjoy the whole world without a sense of craving.</P>

    <P>&nbsp;What is boredom? </P>
<P>&nbsp;A repetition without interest or love causes a monotonous state of mind; that is boredom. It overshadows the Self. </P>
<P>&nbsp;A practice or <I>abhyasa</I> is again a repetition whose purpose is to destroy the boredom and reunite with the Self. In this process the practice itself creates boredom and as you continue, it penetrates the boredom and destroys it once and for all. Whether the practice gives you joy or boredom, it must be continued. Only the practice or <I>abhyasa</I> can annihilate the Mind.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Self is Love and Love is always repetitive. That is why love letters are simply repetitive and there is no boredom there. If you are bored with yourself then how much more boring you would be for others. Root out the boredom in you through deep and continued meditation.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Wake up and Walk up.</P>

    <P>&nbsp;There are three forces: <I>Brahma shakti, Vishnu shakti, </I>and <I>Shiva shakti</I>. You may have one of these predominant. <I>Brahma shakti</I> is the force to create something new. <I>Vishnu shakti</I> is maintenance and <I>Shiva shakti</I> is bringing in transformation, filling in life, or destroying.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Some of you have <I>Brahma shakti</I>. You may create well, but you may not be able to maintain. For example, you may make friends very fast, but it does not last long. </P>
<P>&nbsp;There are others who cannot create but are good at maintaining. For example, people have long lasting friendships but cannot make any new friends. In such cases, <I>Vishnu shakti</I> is dominant. </P>
<P>&nbsp;And then there are others who have more of <I>Shiva shakti</I>. They bring in new life or transformation or they can destroy the whole set up.</P>
<P>&nbsp;In <I>Guru shakti</I>, all three <I>shaktis</I> have blossomed fully. </P>
<P>&nbsp;So each of you first identify which <I>shakti</I> you have more of and aspire for <I>Guru shakti</I>. Guru makes a group but a group cannot make a Guru.</P>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>HOW TO MAINTAIN INTIMACY</B></P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;Intimacy often gets broken because of ego or your desire. What breaks intimacy?</P>

    <DIR>
    
    <P>&#9;Ego or taking a position</P>
    <P>&#9;Desire</P>
    <P>&#9;Taking intimacy for granted</P>
    <P>&#9;Finding imperfection in oneself or others</P>
    <P>&#9;Expectations</P>
    <P>&#9;Insensitivity or over sensitivity</P>
    <P>&#9;Lack of vivek or vairagya (lack of discretion or dispassion)</P>
    <P>&#9;Judgements</P>
    <P>&#9;Grumbling or lack of gratitude</P></DIR>
    
    
    <P>Dissolving into infinity is the way to maintain intimacy. Intimacy is dissolving into infinity. Dissolving into infinity brings you to the moment. Go beyond events. Dissolve into infinity, be in the moment, and look beyond the events. This is the way to maintain intimacy.</P>
    <P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * </P>
    <P>If you attend Satsang you don't get much; but if you don't, you lose a lot. Just to maintain where you are, what you are, you need to attend weekly Satsang. </P>
    <P>&nbsp;Now, start doing ten minutes of Satsang, sharing of the Knowledge with someone, anyone. You are so used to talking gossip. Now for two weeks, talk Knowledge, especially to those not coming to Satsang. Even on the phone -- suppose you can't find someone at seven o'clock; call someone on the phone and talk Knowledge for a couple of minutes: "What are you doing? What do you want? How can I help you?" Praise the Divine.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;This is an exercise. Every day for ten minutes, do individual Satsang and skillfully talk ten minutes of Knowledge. Say, "Everything is temporary, everything is changing." Speak some Knowledge on the changing nature of the world.</P>

<P>&nbsp;This is exactly what happens in life. Many want sweetness in life. Some are searching hard, but only one finds it. And when that one finds it, he gives it to everyone.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Everyone is blissed in and some are blissed out, too!</P>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>OVERCOMING EVENTS</B></P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;All the problems that you face in life are because you attach over importance to the events. The events grow bigger while you remain smaller. Say, for example, you are riding a motorbike on a busy motor way and in front of you there is another vehicle emitting exhaust fumes. You have three options.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1. &#9;You can complain, somehow bear with it, and still follow the vehicle.</P>
<P>2. &#9;You can slow down or wait for some time to allow the vehicle to move far away from you.</P>
<P>3. &#9;You can use your skill, overtake the vehicle, and forget about it.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>As in the first case, most of you stick on the events and are miserable, like inhaling fumes throughout your journey.</P>
<P>In the second case, you don't get permanent relief, as another bigger vehicle might come in front of you. Like that, running away from events is not the permanent solution.</P>
<P>However, wise people use their skill and grow over the events. If the vehicle is in perfect condition, the skill is effective. Conditioning the vehicle is <I>sadhana</I> or practice. And skill is the grace of the Guru.</P>
<P>The mistakes that you have made in the past have made you humble; you need not make mistakes in the future to become humble.</P>

      <P>&nbsp;Pure water is like love, Knowledge is like detergent, mind is like cloth, and the body like the washing machine. If you put in mud instead of detergent, your clothes become dirtier than before.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;You will have to go on putting clothes in the washing machine to get them cleaned. And the process repeats again and again. Similarly you will have many more births until you stop repeating the mistakes that you have made.</P>

</B><P>&nbsp;During Satsang, Guruji opened a small nicely-wrapped present. It was a tiny bottle of jasmine perfume. He twisted off the cap and sniffed the lovely fragrance. Then he proceeded to pour a small amount on some paper which he waved in the air, wafting the scent to all corners of the hall. Everyone could then enjoy it.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Guruji explained that it is not enough simply to have the fragrance. We have to know how to spread it. Flowers have the fragrance, but it is the wind that comes and spreads it. In the same way, each one of us is wonderful within -- we are beautiful, caring, and loving. But we do not know how to spread the fragrance.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Satsang is that wind which comes and spreads this fragrance to everyone.</P>

      <P>&nbsp;A student's job is to satisfy the Master.</P>
      <P>But how can you satisfy someone who is already satisfied?</P>
      <P>&nbsp;If Guru is satisfied, then your growth is shunned.</P>
      <P>If Guru is unsatisfied, he's away from the Self.</P>
      <P>If Guru is satisfied, then what can inspire you to grow?</P>
      <P>&nbsp;If he's unsatisfied, he cannot be a Guru.</P>
      <P>If he's satisfied, he cannot be a Guru.</P>

      <P>&nbsp;<B>NEWS FLASH</P>
      </B><P>&nbsp;Guruji arrived for the first time on January 15th in the Croatian capital of Zagreb. As soon as we landed, Guruji was driven straight to one of the largest concert halls in Zagreb. Guruji first met with a group of over a hundred professionals including doctors and members of the press. A few hours later the hall was filled to capacity for his evening lecture. The national television station filmed the entire talk. Over 100 people waited outside unable to enter. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;Before addressing the large crowd Guruji went out to the lobby and greeted those who could not enter. His talk was exquisite and a soft feeling of grace and peace transformed the atmosphere. At the end of the lecture many still waited outside for over two hours to get a glimpse of Guruji.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;The next evening Guruji gave his first talk in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Hundreds crowded into the World Trade Center. Guruji was soon overloaded with flowers from the group. Guruji continued to talk for an hour and a half as the enthusiastic crowd would not let him finish. The atmosphere was charged with immense gratitude and celebration. The Art of Living groups in Croatia and Slovenia have done an excellent job.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;Guruji now flies off to New York for a television interview and then it's on to the advanced course in Hawaii!</P>

    <P>&nbsp;What type of time do you give the Divine? Usually you give the time that is leftover, when you have nothing else to do, when no guests are coming, there are no parties to go to, no nice movies to watch, no weddings to attend. Such time you give. This is not quality time. </P>
<P>&nbsp;Give quality time to the Divine. It will be rewarded. If your prayers are not answered it is because you have never given quality time. Give Satsang and meditation your highest priority. Give prime time to the Divine. You definitely will be rewarded.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * </P>
<P>&nbsp;Here in Hawaii there is a fun-filled course, for you know <I>God Loves Fun</I>. This has been followed with the long-awaited book, <I>Way of Grace</I>. Satsang is open to the public each evening. The huge waves of the Hawaiian shores cannot compete with the waves of bliss at Satsang. Guruji has brought out deep Knowledge from the most mundane questions. We are making efforts to bring these tapes to you soon.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * </P>
<P>What is most freely given yet not taken?</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1.&#9;Compliments? . . . no.</P>
<P>2.&#9;Blame? . . . no, people take blame.</P>
<P>3.&#9;Money? . . . no, money is readily taken, not freely given.</P>
<P>4.&#9;Happiness? . . . nobody can give happiness.</P>
<P>5. &#9;??</P></DIR>

<P>The clue is that it hangs in space like an orphan. No one owns it. Like an overripe papaya in Hawaii, it rots.</P>
<P>The answer to this riddle lies in the beginning.</P>
<P>ALOHA!</P>

  <P>&nbsp;There is a place you can come where everything is beautiful. Tourists go from place to place looking for beauty. They try to take beauty from that place. They only get tired and tanned. Yet the most beautiful spot anywhere is right here. When you come here, you find that wherever you are, everything is so beautiful.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Where is this place? Don't look here and there. Where do you go? Within you. When you come here, then any place is beautiful. Then wherever you go, you add beauty there.</P>
<P>&nbsp;If you are unhappy, even the moon is irritating to you. Sweet things are nauseating, music is disturbing. When you are calm and centered inside, noise is musical, clouds are magical, rain is liquid sunshine.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Book yourself on a trip to this most beautiful place in the universe. Then you find that every day is a vacation and a celebration.</P>

  		<P>&nbsp;<B>And now the NEWS splash from the surf</B>: </P>
<P>&nbsp;A lady was driving along the coast of Kauai and just started singing our Bhajans which she had never heard before. Later she found herself at our Satsang.</P>
<P>&nbsp;A Hawaiian Princess, Owana, found herself wondering why she felt compelled to drive in circles around a hotel in Honolulu. Later she found out from a devotee that it was Guruji's hotel. The next night she was singing her deeply felt native Hawaiian songs at Punditji's feet.</P>
<P>&nbsp;On Sunday, a lady named Mary was spending the day at an ancient temple ruins. She had gone there to make an offering and to pray. Her prayer was to meet her spiritual teacher and be shown the way Home. On Monday, she met Punditji and instantly became devoted. </P>

</B><P>&nbsp;Question: God is all abundant, all full and we are connected to God. Then why are we in debt, except for some? Why do they have, and we don't have?</P>
<P>&nbsp;Guruji: Is it only money? You have abundance, yet at the same time, you are indebted. So how can both be true? How can you be indebted and at the same time have abundance?</P>
<P>&nbsp;Somebody says: An abundance of indebtedness!</P>
<P>&nbsp;Guruji: When you say you are indebted, that means you have received. Otherwise how can you be indebted? So be thankful for being indebted, because you have received. Those who have received should feel indebted. If you don't feel indebted, you cannot have abundance. So the more indebted you feel, the more abundance you have.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Question: When the disciples met Jesus, they were not very successful, did not catch very many fish. When they met Jesus, he told them exactly where to fish and that's when they got lots of fish and then they decided to follow Jesus. </P>
<P>&nbsp;(Laughter)</P>
<P>&nbsp;Guruji: Feel indebted. Feel gratitude. Then abundance comes. As long as you are wanting for abundance you get indebted. Feel indebtedness and gratitude, then abundance comes.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Abundance and indebtedness coexist. You think you are indebted, but you really are not. It is better to feel totally indebted, because every bit of what you have, doesn't belong to you, including your body. Then you are infinitely indebted for your body, for Knowledge, for things you have received, and for your own life. Then you bask in the abundance of the Creator.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Someone says: I feel very indebted. Thank you!</P>

<P>&nbsp;Physicians of Apple Valley had organized memorable meetings and Satsangs. Guruji was on CNN News. Guruji was in the media and newspapers for several days before the much awaited event. Local TV stations were announcing the event every hour. </P>
<P>&nbsp;From there -- unbelievable Satsangs in packed halls in Los Angeles. The drummers and Divya got everyone on their feet. The atmosphere was electrifying. </P>
<P>&nbsp;Guruji went to the University of Northeast Missouri that had sponsored his visit. Students and Lloyd had organized 700 people to welcome Guruji.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Guruji, not only in spirit, but also physically, piloted a twin engine Cessna plane back to St. Louis, Missouri on his way to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The church was filled with devotion and decorations. The way Guruji looked -- the Grace and Knowledge were so magical -- the scene is impossible to describe. The hurricane of<I> Satva </I>has moved on to Miami. </P>

  		<P>&nbsp;<B>NEWS FLASH</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;Just a week before Guruji's arrival, Raj woke up in the middle of the night in Loughborough. He thought that some light was coming from the clock. He looked at Guruji's picture and saw that light was coming from it. This light grew and filled the room. He made sure that there was no outside light left on. The divine light stayed on for about ten minutes.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Upholland, Lancashire held an advanced course in Guruji's presence.</P>
<P>Guruji gave a talk on Ayurveda and the Art of Living at the Liverpool Medical Institution. The hall was full to capacity with standing room only, attended by medical professionals. It was a brilliant talk, but Punditji did not think so! He thought it was very mundane! There was great enthusiasm, however.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Next, Guruji's entourage moved with luggage and cars at its own speed and proceeded to Stourbridge in the Midlands for a talk organized by Stourbridge Earth Mysteries. The talk was simply great! The entourage then moved on to London, arriving at 3 o' clock in the morning for "The UK Tired of Living Teacher's Meeting" with baggage, blankets, pillows, plastic bags, pots and pans, and the usual divine chaos!!</P>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>KNOWLEDGE AND FAITH</B></P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;In science you have knowledge first, and then faith follows.</P>
<P>In spirituality, faith comes first, and then Knowledge follows.</P>
<P>For example, the knowledge that pesticides and chemical fertilizers are good for plants came through science, and people had faith in it, and all over the world they were used. And then another knowledge came that they were not good and the faith shifted to organic farming. The same with antibiotics. </P>
<P>The knowledge brought faith, the knowledge changed, and then faith changed. The knowledge and faith of science is of "happening." In spirituality, faith is first and Knowledge comes later. Like Kriya, Yoga, and meditation -- first you have faith and then Knowledge follows. For example, if you do pranayama faithfully then you get the Knowledge of the prana; if your do your meditation faithfully, the Knowledge of consciousness follows. Even an illiterate, through faith, attains deep Knowledge.</P>
<P>Vinod: Human is the best composite material. (Laughter -- this is the NASA scientist mind.)</P>
<P>Punditji: Science considers even human as matter, and spirituality considers even earth as mother, even rivers and mountains as living beings.</P>
<P>Science regards life as matter and spirituality regards even matter as life.</P> 		</font>

<P><I>Shivaratri</I> was celebrated in London as well as in the German Ashram. Devotees had put their hearts and souls to make the place so beautiful. The puja and Satsang transported everyone to another plane. As usual, laughter filled the corridors of the new Ashram. The big hall was already too small to the surprise of everyone! Our own spring water replaced Pepsi and Coke!</P>
<P>Then on to Copenhagen -- the capital of Denmark. It was a media event: people from TV, radio, and the newspaper were queuing into the hotel. The TV crew followed to the public talks which were packed and very lively.</P>
<P>Then the giggling gang moved on to Norway, but had left some luggage behind in the hotel. The flight was conveniently delayed, which was very unusual for SAS. Lakshmi had called Guruji the night before. Guruji had said we will arrive at the airport at exactly 12:15. It kept Lakshmi wondering and confused because it was almost one hour later than the original arrival time. And they all arrived on the dot at 12:15!</P>
<P>Wait for the exciting news from Norway and Sweden next week.</P>

      <P>&nbsp;Why do you respect someone? Because of their good qualities, isn't it? For example, positive qualities like honesty, wisdom, love, talents, behavior. But all these change in time. And when they do change, you lose respect. You only respect the greatness. </P>
<P>&nbsp;I have tremendous respect for each and every one. Not for their greatness or wisdom or talent, but for their very person. I respect everyone totally. So I can never lose respect for anybody, however they may be. One doesn't need to be great in order to be respected. Respecting the life makes you great. Don't look for respect from others; that makes you weak. Have respect for the self and no one can take your self-respect.</P>

It was -10 C and everyone was wearing heavy winter clothes, but there was Guruji, sledding with sandals and shawl. He didn't get a speck of snow on Himself.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Stockholm, Sweden: A TV crew was waiting in the meditation hall to interview him. They asked him what he thought about the New Age, if the Art of Living was part of the New Age. A moment of silence passed and with a vivid smile he replied, "Age is always new."</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Another programme entitled "The Three Wise Men" was made with one of Sweden's most respected TV journalists for a major TV channel. The three wise men included Guruji and the Dalai Lama.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Evening talks were filled with humor, brilliant questions were asked, and laughter filled the air. All the "hard nuts" started popping like popcorn. As usual, the best talks are never recorded.</P>

<P>Before Guruji arrived in Delhi, everything was meticulously planned and organized. When Guruji arrived, there was a spontaneous Satsang at the airport. Airport personnel and other passengers joined in. It was sparkling! The well-organized plans went haywire and the usual divine chaos followed. Everything was settled in a flash but the organizers were left holding the plans on paper!</P>
<P>There was an air of celebration at Saritha Vihar Satsang. The sweets and flowers made a carpet in the large hall that matched the fragrance of joy. At Karol Bagh, the next day, there was more than one reason for the authorities to raise their eyebrows -- stampede in the room, traffic jam on roads, and devotees forgetting their families in their eagerness to follow the "Gurumobile." Then on to Rishikesh and the teachers' refresher course. </P>
<P>Rishikesh. The lush green Himalayas all around -- in the front, the holy Ganges that roars, gurgles, and sometimes murmurs -- the sounds mingling with the chirping of the birds -- the call of the peacocks in the early morning -- the chiming of the temple bells at sunrise -- the chanting of Vedic hymns at all times. Dip in the cold waters -- everyone clad in shawls and sweaters on their way in -- and most reluctant to leave afterwards. Sitting with Guruji in the evening, watching the sunset. Electrifying Satsangs and discourses on Bhagwad Gita in Hindi by Guruji, transport everyone to a blissful, celestial experience. More about Rishikesh next week.</P>

<P>&nbsp;It appeared that all the Gods from heaven came down to earth to the holy town of Rishikesh to bask in the glory of the Master. The powerful Himalayas and the divine Ganges echo the sounds of joy and the laughter of the devotees. </P>
<P>&nbsp;Today is Gudi Padwa and Ugadi --- the new year celebrated in many parts of India. All 350 devotees went for a dip in the holy Ganges at 4:30 a.m. with Guruji oblivious to the temperature of the river. This was a new start to the new year in the presence of the Divine. </P>
<P>&nbsp;The most renowned, 75-year old saint of Rishikesh, Swami Pragyanandji had a vision in which he saw Guruji as Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh with many arms. He then performed a puja to Guruji.</P>

      <P>When a worldly man is miserable, he blames the people around him, the system, and the world in general. </P>
<P>When a seeker is miserable he, of course, blames the world, but in addition he blames the path, the Knowledge, and himself. </P>
<P>It is better not to be a seeker so that you blame less. But then a seeker (<I>sadhak</I>) also enjoys everything much more. There is more love in life and more pain. When there is more joy, the contrast is greater. A certain level of maturity is needed to see things as they are and not to blame the path, the self, and the world. Do you see what I am saying?</P>
<P>It is like a quantum leap. If one jumps across this threshold then there is no fall.</P>
<P>The Divine does not test you. Testing is part of ignorance. </P>
<P>Who will test? One who does not know will test, isn't it? God knows your capacity, so why does he have to test you? Then, why the misery? It is <I>thithiksha</I>, or forbearance, in you. And forbearance could be increased by prayerful surrender or vigorous challenge for patience! (Laughter)</P>

<P>&nbsp;Picnic to Neelkant hills and holy Haridwar was a grand finale to the Rishikesh course, followed by a wild Satsang in New Delhi. It was so charged! Guruji is back in the Ashram for a quiet three days before his Australian tour.</P>
<P>&nbsp;From U.K.: Guruji had given a rose to a lady on February 13 and they called to say that the flower was still amazingly fresh and fragrant after six weeks! This miracle inspired an otherwise unwilling lady to do the course.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Important exercise: Find out what it is that has been with you forever. Belma says that she asked herself this question 20 years ago and she knows all the answers. And that there is only one answer . . . . (Laughter)</P>

<P>When someone is drowning in the ocean of attachments, surrender is the life jacket they can put on and wait for the rescue team. Without fighting the attachments, observe the feverish breath and go to the cool place of silence within. Your first step in this direction is directing your attachment to the Knowledge, to the Divine.</P>

<P>&nbsp;Singapore snatched a Satsang on the way to Australia.</P>

      <P>&nbsp;We attach meaning to words and we distort them, too. For example, the word "brainwashing." Like your body, your brain needs washing sometimes.

<P>&nbsp;Like that, the word "disillusionment." It is good that you are disillusioned. You have come to reality. Like <I>purana.</I> It means "that which is new in the town, the most modern." But it is used in the sense of being old. In the course of time, meanings of words change. The word "enthused" comes from the Greek which means "God is with us." Then it came to mean crazy, and now it's changed again.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Don't be stuck with the words. Your worries are words. Your ideas are words. Wisdom is beyond words. It is the very Being. It is the essence of all words. See and relate beyond words. Then there is no lie in your life.</P>
<P>&nbsp;If you manipulate words, it is a lie. If you play on words, it is a joke. If you rely on words, it is ignorance. If you transcend words, it is wisdom.</P>

<P>&nbsp;Guruji was welcomed with the traditional Balinese dance and garlands. Then the press and TV crews invaded the hotel and splashed the news throughout Indonesia. All the press people were put into silent meditation and they came out with big smiles. Now they are arranging courses.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Everything was magical. A thousand stars reflected over the Indian Ocean and the cliff side pool. Surprisingly, this course did not have chaos! The harmony on the course was so great that the hotel staff spontaneously started observing silence, communicating only through gestures and notes. Mr. and Mrs. Tolani and their whole team did a great job.</P>
<P>&nbsp;After the farewell dinner outside by the lotus pools, we enjoyed a Balinese dance drama from the Ramayana. Afterwards we had a lively Satsang as drops began to fall from the heavens. Everyone was singing and dancing in the rain with Guruji.</P>

It makes some rich and some poor. All the struggle in the world, whatever it may be, is the bondage of Karma. It cuts across all logic and reasoning. This understanding will lift you from getting stuck to the events or personalities and help you in your Journey to the Self.</P>

Many dignitaries including ministers and officials of Singapore and Malaysia were present. Among the others were Chinese musicians and Indian dancers.

<P>&nbsp;The skies opened and grace poured down in buckets at the Ashram this week. It was a confluence of eight prominent saints of India who in a private meeting honored Guruji in one of their ashrams. Each of these saints gives lectures or Darshan to hundreds of thousands of devotees and they all run their own schools, hospitals and ashrams. Four of them who were just introduced to Guruji followed us for a brief tour of our Ashram.</P>
<P>&nbsp;When they were all at Sumeru Mantap, lightening and thunder surrounded us and everyone was drenched and then they ran to Guruji's kutir. Immediately these very popular and formal Sanyasis began to shed their orange garments. But what to give them to wear? Guruji gave them all white dhotis. Soon they were all wearing our Guruji's white dhotis and being fed by his hand looking more and more like a group of joyful children happy to be home again. Somehow in their "new clothes" they began to relax and smile and laugh and soon the grace of our Guru had them radiating from deep inside. </P>
<P>&nbsp;All of us were shocked to see how the formal heads of institutions were transformed and by the time they were leaving, they humbly asked for Guruji's blessings and invited him to their ashrams and to lead them in meditation. They said, "Mother Nature gave us all a bath before entering your temple, Guruji." We stood and watched this event with awe and laughter.</P>
<P>&nbsp;The first advanced course has started at the Ashram.</P>

    <P>&nbsp;Deep sleep can be<I> jada</I> <I>samadhi</I> (equanimity with inertia). And hence, sleep is the main factor in healing. Even medicines will not help without sleep and rest.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;<I>Samadhi</I> with ecstasy has no logic. This is <I>nirvitarka</I> <I>samadhi</I>, awareness with bliss.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;<I>Nirvitarka samadhi</I> is even beyond the experience of bliss, undefinable beyond words.</P>

          <P>&nbsp;<B>NEWS FLASH</B>:</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Just on the outskirts of Paris, the advanced course at the Hotel Leonardo da Vinci was great. The manager at the hotel turned into a devotee and expressed that his place was never filled with so much love and light. The Satsang, sight-seeing, and the feast on the boat in Paris at night was a rendezvous with the Divine.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;The next morning five cars and a mini-van set out for Holland without any proper address but the miracle was that everybody reached the lecture hall in time. Some were fuming that they had not been given any address or telephone numbers. </P>
    <P>&nbsp;They all cooled down in one minute as Guruji smiled and said, "Have trust and fun. If you lose your smile for small things, then what is the use of being with me? It is a double waste of time, yours and mine." The celebration continued past midnight and this Knowledge Sheet was born.</P>

<P>&nbsp;On the way back from Holland to the German Ashram we had a picnic on the banks of the river Rhine near beautiful Boppard.</P>
<P>&nbsp;The Ashram was filled to its capacity. Teacher Training Phase 1 and 2 and the advanced course were in full swing.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Our spring water has a mind of its own. It flows for some people when they go near it and stops for others. Whenever Kirpal went with Guruji's jug, the water joyfully rushed forth!</P>

        <P>Today marks the one year anniversary of these Knowledge Sheets. The year which started in Big Sur and is ending in St. Louis, began in KNOWLEDGE and is concluding in SEVA. Knowledge Sheets now go to more than 300 Satsang groups touching 7000 people every week around the world!</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>SEVA IS SAVIOR</B></P>
      
      <P>&nbsp;The way to expand from individual to universal consciousness is to share others's sorrow and joy. As you grow, your consciousness should also grow. When you expand in Knowledge with time, then depression is not possible. Your inner most source is joy.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;The way to overcome personal misery is to share universal misery! The way to expand personal joy is to share universal joy. Instead of thinking "what about me?" "what can I gain from this world?" think "what can I do for the world?" When everyone comes from the point of contributing to society, you have a Divine society. We have to educate and culture our individual consciousness in order to expand in time with the Knowledge . . . from "what about me?" to "what can I contribute?"</P>
      <P>&nbsp;If you are not having good experiences in meditation, then do more seva -- you will gain merit and your meditation will be deeper. When you bring some relief or freedom to someone through seva, good vibrations and blessings come to you. Seva brings merit; merit allows you to go deep in meditation; meditation brings back your smile.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>&nbsp;<B>Answer to last week's riddle:</B> </P>
      <P>&nbsp;That something which is so precious to you is your smile -- your joy. You lose it in the world and find it in the self, in Satsang. If you can't find it here, at the Ashram, forget about it. Your can't find it anywhere.</P>

The world appears imperfect on the surface but underneath, all is perfect. Perfection hides; imperfection shows off. </P>
    <P>&nbsp;The wise will not stay on the surface but will probe into the depth. Things are not blurred; your vision is blurred. Infinite actions prevail in the wholeness of consciousness. And yet the consciousness remains perfect, untouched. As Satsangees, realize this now and be at Home.</P>

    <P>&nbsp;<B>NEWS FLASH from BBC (Beautiful British Columbia)</B>:</P>
    <P>&nbsp;In St. Louis a man diagnosed with a malignancy in his shoulder came to receive Guruji's blessings. The next day he came to Satsang and to the astonishment of the doctors, the man had been healed even though the MRI had shown a tear and a growth on the shoulder cuff. As the man told his story and presented a dozen red roses to Guruji, tears of gratitude rolled down everyone's cheeks. There were many reported healing experiences in St. Louis and Chicago.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;The Chicago organizers said, "Here comes the Art of Living circus to town." (Laughter) There was an air of celebration as the devotees from the U.S. Midwest gathered with non-stop giggling and laughter. People were driving in circles, forgetting traffic rules, not sleeping, and laughing as Guruji (our sit-down comedian) amazed everyone.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;We rushed on to Portland. Dean says we have become Rushins instead of American, Indians, and Canadians. At The Old Church, there was not even standing space. The sight of Guruji put smiles on every face.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;In Vancouver, the Aboriginal People warmly hosted Guruji at the University of British Columbia. The sky, the sea, the snow-capped mountains, the tall trees and the waterfalls all beckoned for the Knowledge.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Sudarshana left the room for five minutes and returned asking, "What did I miss?" Marcy said, "Enlightenment!" (Laughter)</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>JUDGEMENTS AND GOOD COMPANY</B></P>
      
      <P>Though you have heard "don't judge," judgement comes unavoidably in day-to-day life. By the actions and behaviors of people, you either approve or disapprove. But always remember that everything is changing, and do not hold onto the judgement. Otherwise your judgement gets solidified like a rock. It brings misery for you and for others.</P>
<P>If judgements are lighter like air, like a breeze, they bring in fragrance, then move away. They could bring a foul smell, then move away. They should not stay there forever.</P>
<P>Judgements are so subtle that you are not even aware of their existence. Judging or labeling someone as judgmental is also a judgement. Only in the state of Being when you are full of love and compassion can you ever be free from all judgements.</P>
<P>Yet the world cannot move without judgements. Until you judge something as good or bad, you cannot do any actions. If you see rotten apples in the market, you say, "No good." Good ones you buy. If someone lies to you ten times, you think next time it also could be a lie. A judgment happens automatically.</P>
<P>See the possibility that people and things can change at any time and don't hold onto the judgements.</P>
<P>You need to judge your company. Your company can pull you up or pull you down. The company that drags you towards doubt, dejection, blame, complaints, anger, delusion, and desires is bad company. The company that pulls you up towards joy, enthusiasm, service, love, trust, and Knowledge is good company.</P>
<P>When someone complains, first you listen, then you nod, then you sympathize, then you complain.</P>
<P>Robert says, "Join the party." Denise says, "I confess, you are absolutely right." (Laughter)</P>
<P>Your company can create Hell for you in Heaven -- or Heaven for you in Hell. Judge for yourself . . . !</P> 		</font>

  		<P>&nbsp;<B>The Circus goes to Ottawa:</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;Enthusiastic Suzannah and party had organized a hall at the palatial Chateau Laurier. There was Guruji, sitting on his beautifully decorated seat next to a huge pile of super-sized bananas. In the darshan line he had to hand out over 300 bananas, one by one, like a banana vendor. There were piles of bananas everywhere.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Guruji said, "Let's all close the eyes and meditate," and everyone was sitting there peeling their bananas. Denise got stuck with her banana peel. She didn't know what to do with it. She (and everyone else) ended up meditating while holding their banana or banana peel like some kind of religious ceremony.</P>
<P>Thanks to Janice, the Ayurvedic Course at the Ashram was a great success. The celebration continues in Montreal . . .</P>

          <P>&nbsp;<B>NEWS FLASH</B>:</P>
    <P>&nbsp;We emerged from silence to celebrate at the lake the fifth anniversary of the Ashram. It was like a fairytale with the full moon rising above the trees, the sounds of Susannah's and Phillip's flutes, fireworks, and bonfires. The Guru took us spinning in circles on a raft and to our surprise brought us back to the same shore. In the confusion, we forgot to serve the anniversary cake.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;After the Montreal talk, Denise drove off with Guruji in the car with all the doors open. Ramola ran from behind and jumped in. In the fever to get into the Guru's car, somebody left luggage behind, another left a purse, another left their shoes, and they all left their minds.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Guruji and Phillip have just left for Toronto and then are to go to Colorado.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;On the 14th of July an Interfaith Prayer and Meditation Conference will be sponsored by the Art of Living in Washington DC. Ten Swamis from India have been invited. </P>
    <P>&nbsp;Thomas called Punditji to tell him that a forest fire raging at Lake Tahoe which burned many million dollar houses, came up to his property, burned his tool shed, but stopped at his front door. Neither his home -- where many Satsangs had been held -- nor his garden were damaged.</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>SURRENDER AND RESPONSIBILITY</B></P>
      
      <P>Setting up a time-bound goal gives direction to the life force. Imagination is essential for this. Most people have a small imagination and are stuck with that, and that causes frustration. But if you are a devotee, you say "Let Thy Will be done" and then you will step lightly to the goal. You will take it easy. We have to make a distinction. Some people say "Let God do everything and surrender" and others say "I have to be responsible."</P>
      <P>Surrender is saying "Let Thy Will be done" and "Thy Will" for you is to take responsibility for the whole world.</P>
      <P>It appears to be opposing and conflicting in nature -- in fact they are two sides of the same coin. The more you surrender, the more responsive you become. One who is irresponsible cannot surrender either. Why is someone irresponsible? They are lazy or fearful or both. If you are lazy or fearful, you cannot be in love.</P>
      <P>Total responsibility is total surrender. It's a little hard to chew, but this is the truth. People usually say either I take responsibility or surrender, but I tell you they go hand in hand. Suppose you are surrendered to the Knowledge. That means you are committed to sharing it with others. You take responsibility to see that it flourishes.</P>
      <P>Question: The confusion comes with the doership?</P>
      <P>Answer: When you are taking responsibility and you find blocks, remember "surrender." That gives you strength to move ahead. It releases you from the weight of the doership. Responsibility is the dynamic expression of life in the present moment. When you are shaken, remember the basis of responsibility as surrender.</P>
      <P>Taking responsibility or surrendering without doership is the skill of the wise. Total irresponsibility is impossible for you. Limited responsibility makes you weak. A little water in the sun will evaporate but the ocean never dries up. Limited responsibility tires you out. Unlimited responsibility empowers you and brings you joy.</P> 		</font>

      <P>&nbsp;The fireworks arrived July 4th with Guruji at Colorado's largest advanced and basic courses ever. The hall was dressed with red, white, and blue balloons and ribbons in celebration of Independence (of the United States and our spirits). As we watched the explosions spread across the horizon, Guruji said, "That looks just like your minds." Guruji took a hike in the mountains and then met an enthusiastic crowd in Colorado Springs before flying on to California. There was a Satsang in Anu and N.J.'s home in Apple Valley for over 150 devotees before the Art of Living entourage moved on to northern California. There have been non-stop talks and Satsangs celebrating Guruji's summer tour to the U.S.</P>

An African holy man swathed in flowing white robes bowed before each delegate and the audience. </P>
        <P>The nine Swamis from India, in their golden robes, dramatically entered the auditorium during the program and gave their blessings to Guruji. Guruji, sitting in the center of them all, provided the closing meditation. John was master of ceremonies and did a wonderful job staying centered amidst the chaos of program changes that nobody even noticed!</P>

    <P>The healthiest way to apply this knowledge is to see the whole past as happening and the present as doing. If you see the past as doing, then ego and regret come along. And when you see the present as happening, then laziness and unawareness set in. If you apply the doing for the future, it brings tension and worry. If you apply the happening for the future, it might bring some confidence and also lethargy.</P>
    <P>Let the happening be for the past. Let the doing be for the present. And the future is a mix of both.</P>

      <P>&nbsp;Warning! Watch out! </B>This Knowledge Sheet contains explosives! It can explode your head or your heart. If it explodes your heart -- nothing is left! If it explodes your head -- everything is attained!</P>
      <P>&nbsp;Guruji: How many of you are grateful here? (<I>Everybody raises their hand</I>.) If you are grateful, you don't belong to Me! (<I>Everyone is shocked</I>.) You are not part of the Master. When someone gives you something, you are grateful. That means you feel separate. You are not grateful to yourself.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;Gratefulness is inevitable. When you go beyond gratefulness, then union happens. No "I," no "you" remains. You are part of the Master. You are just One Being with a thousand heads and a thousand arms, but with one heart. You have got to be grateful on the path, but you have to transcend gratefulness. Better stop being grateful. (<I>Laughter.</I>) </P>
      <P>&nbsp;When you are grateful then <I>you</I> are the center, <I>you</I> are more important. When you are grateful to God for having received something beautiful, for example, eyesight, who is important? You or God? You! So your gratitude indicates ego.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;Richard: But you are not grateful?</P>
      <P>Guruji: I am simply great and I am full! (<I>Laughter</I>) Don't be grateful; just be great -- and be full! (<I>Laughter</I>)</P>
      <P>&nbsp;This Knowledge is very dangerous! When you are part of the Master, you have every right to be happy. You have every right to Knowledge, happiness, and the whole universe!</P>
      <P>Angelika: Small children donÒ´ feel grateful as long as they feel one. They take everything for granted. </P>
      <P>Meike: You are not grateful to your own hand which feeds you.</P>
      <P>Ananda: On one of the courses you said in the thanking process, "Now, thank yourself for being here!" So you can thank yourself.</P>
      <P>Guruji: if you wish, you can! This is true celebration: thanking yourself!</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * *</P>
      <P>&nbsp;Balder: Could you say something about the relationship to friends and the relationship to the Master?</P>
      <P>Guruji: Your friends tie you to the world, to the matter. The Master ties you to the Divine, to the spirit.</P> 		</font>

      <P>&nbsp;Guru Purnima was celebrated all around the world. In the German Academy, people who had been there earlier could not believe their eyes. The Seva Warriors had made such a magic on the whole building. The "Moonwalk" on the mountain after Satsang was simply great and everyone was full!</P>

        <P>Mr. John Pb: But people with good intellect seem to have less faith.</P>
        <P>Guruji: They have more faith in the matter. Head puts the faith in the matter more and heart puts the faith in the abstract more.</P>
        <P>It's next to impossible that one can be in total lack of faith or total lack of devotion. It's only a question of balance.</P>

        <P><B>NEWS FLASH</B></P>
        </B><P>Guruji arrived at the Washington airport and drove to three Satsangs and had dinner, then dinner, then dinner. Next day Bhanu shopped from 10 am to 5 pm.</P>
        <P>Bhanu says, "Don't write that!"</P>
        <P>Dr. Ganesh Prabhu, one of the leading cardiovascular surgeons, formerly of Johns Hopkins Hospital, asked if he could sit and meditate alone with Guruji without anyone else around. The deal was struck. Dr. Prabhu used a holter monitor on Guruji to measure the heart function while he was meditating. Afterwards Guruji departed for Los Angeles.</P>
        <P>Dr. Prabhu called Guruji at about 8:00 that evening with the information that the heart rate recorded went from 10 per minute to 2 and stopped completely twice. He was even more excited and amazed that the machine kept recording a heartbeat for nearly 10 hours after being disconnected from Guruji. He asked, "What happened? What happened?" His joy knew no limits. Never before in his career had he seen anything like this. He said he would frame the read-out.</P>
        <P>Guruji arrived in Los Angeles for the long-awaited Summer Celebration. Sixty people were on seva teams with Ann McFadden at the helm. Nine swamis who were our guests began an intensive sightseeing campaign, dragging Wally and John through Disneyland, Universal Studios, and Sea World starting at 8:00 in the morning. Often you could hear the swamis saying, "Where is Honey?" (Wally's motor home.)</P>
        <P>There was a grand Satsang in San Diego with the Swamis. Then as Guruji arrived in L.A. there was a memorable Prayer Conference evening at the famous Agape Center. Everyone spoke about unity. Then Guruji stood up and shocked the audience by saying, "Unity is impossible." He continued by explaining that in order for there to be unity, there has to be two. Yet there is only One in the whole universe.</P>
        <P>Next day Guruji gave a beautiful talk at the Unity Church in Tustin. "All of your life becomes a meditation," he said. "Whether you look at the trees or the flowers or talk with people, you are in meditation." He encouraged people to stay with their daily meditation practice. After the talk we all looked up and saw a big puffy heart in the clear blue sky. That evening there was an electrifying Satsang with many birthdays at the Doubletree Hotel with 350 course participants.</P>

          <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>INFINITE PATIENCE AND SMART SHOPPING</B></P>
          
          <P>Suppose you go to God, get a boon, and walk away. When your intention is to get a boon, then you are in a hurry. Another person who knows he owns God is not in a hurry for anything. Infinite patience comes up in him.</P>
          <P>When you know you own God, you are not in a hurry to get something out of God. Your hurry to get something throws you off balance and makes you small. Have "eternal wait," infinite patience. When you have infinite patience, you will realize God belongs to you. Either through awareness or through practice you reach the same spot.</P>
          <P>Question: What do you mean by "owning God?"</P>
          <P>Answer: The Divinity belongs to you. It's not like shopping at the supermarket in a hurry and rushing back home. When you see the whole store is at home, you are not in a hurry to shop. You are at ease.</P>
          <P>Question: To develop patience do we just observe the impatience?</P>
          <P>Answer: Just observe the thoughts and feelings and don't regret about it.</P>
          <P>When you know you are part of the divine plan, you stop demanding. Then you know everything is being done for you. You are taken care of. Usually we do it the other way: we hurry the mind and are slow in our action. Impatience means hurry in the mind; lethargy means slowness in action. Patience in the mind and dynamism in action is the right formula.</P> 		</font>

          </B><P>Thousands came to the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium to hear Guruji's wisdom, experience silence in guided meditation, and celebrate with singing and dancing. People could take the magic home because the talks were immediately available on tape as everyone left the hall. All the talks listed below are available to you by calling (800) 574-3001 in the U.S. and (503) 227-6411 from outside the U.S.</P>

          <P>It was a big week. Newspapers published articles, television ran interviews, and hundreds came to attend intro and advanced courses. Teachers from all over North America are being revised and revived. </P>
          <P>No one was concerned about the Blackout of( Ñ¹6XXXXX), which affected six states between Canada and Mexico, because Guruji promised the lights would come on before the talk. And they did! </P>
          <P>For people who do not have a teacher in their area and/or have not taken the Intro Course, Guruji is structuring an evening of chanting and knowledge. More on this soon.</P>

The head that bends in surrender will never have to bend in shame. Shame accompanies arrogance. Shyness accompanies Love. See how children are endowed with shyness, that is natural. Shyness is inherent. Shame is inflicted by society and is acquired. Shame brings guilt and shyness adds to oneÒ³ beauty. Retain your shyness and drop your shame.</P> 		</font>

<P>Parag and Parul were taken by surprise when the food brought just for Guruji and four others was fed to forty people and still there was some left over.</P>
<P>The Advanced Teacher Training was immensely beneficial and the teachers left with renewed wisdom and fire. </P>
<P>As people would crowd into Verna's home and the slamming of car doors after midnight was awakening the entire Bayliss neighborhood, so Guruji played a trick and took everyone to the beach! A big group gathered in the airport, there was a change in flight, and the airport authorities requested our people not to crowd! Rajshree's family hosted a nice Satsang in Yonkers. A public Satsang was given for the first time in Princeton, New Jersey and the talk in New York was greatly admired by everyone. Guruji gave four television programs in this tour, including The Discovery Channel and Korean TV. Before boarding the plane to the UK, Guruji took a private visit to the amusement park (with only 40 people) and the water rides and the roller coaster were great fun. </P>

Guruji kept winning by twisting their arguments and people laughed like anything.</P>
        <P>Guruji: Whether you win or lose an argument with me you are still laughing. Why?</P>
        <P>Because there is total sense of belongingness. When there is a total sense of belongingness, real play happens. Winning or losing is irrelevant.</P>
        <P>Normally what happens to you when you lose an argument? You are sad and upset, hurt and angry. But when you lose or win an argument with me you are still happy. How come?</P>
        <P>1. There is a sense of belongingness.</P>
        <P>2. Your love stands out and everything else becomes secondary. Like perfection, comfort,</P>

The next morning in Baroda, Guruji addressed a rapt audience of 700 senior executives. In the evening Satsang the assembly hall of the palace of Baroda was an apt royal setting. Thanks to Kartik for setting up closed circuit TVs -- the overflowing crowd did not feel lost.</P>

        <P><B>NEWS FLASH</B></P>
        </B><P>After a busy course schedule in the Ashram, Bangalore, Guruji addressed a large group of professionals and industrialists in Rajkot followed by an enthusiastic Satsang of more than 3000 devotees. Decorations and the organization and spirit of the enthusiastic crowd set an example. Guruji left for an advanced course of nearly 700 participants in Koijavaran, Baroda. </P>
        <P>P.S. Although the Knowledge Sheet was prepared on time last week there was a delay in sending it and this brought up an interesting fax from Ottawa, Canada which is enclosed here as a supplement:</P>
        <P>Thank you for this week's very eloquent Knowledge Fax. We continue to ponder its meaning. In deciphering its meaning we rely on clues that you have given previously. You have said, "I am always talking to you. You only have to look for a sign."</P>
        <P>We recognize that many people will say, "There was no Knowledge Fax this week." Of course, they are mistaken. Some people will say, "The Guru finally missed a deadline. Of course, He is just human, like everyone else. He probably ran out of things to say, got tired. Maybe there was no computer nearby. Maybe he called in sick." Some people, asleep, may not have noticed.</P>
        <P>However, knowing that the Guru is communicating even when He says nothing at all, we seek the deeper meaning of the week's Knowledge Sheet or Nonsheet. Let us simply say, We seek the deeper meaning of this week's Sandesh. </P>
        <P>Option 1: It is all changing</P>
        <P>Everything is changing. Nothing stays for all time. "Life is teaching us, at every moment, the art of letting go." Even Knowledge Faxes will not be there for ever. Letting Go. Ultimately we must let go of even the Knowledge as object, as something "out there."</P>
        <P>Option 2. I am the Knowledge </P>
        <P>Living the knowledge, becoming the knowledge. That is what we must aspire to. The Knowledge Fax is not just a piece of paper, a bit of amusement each week, which titillates the intellect and which we promptly forget, and go about our meaningless and mundane lives. </P>
        <P>Sub-Option 2.1. "Enough Knowledge has been given. Digest that." </P>
        <P>We must assimilate the Knowledge that has already been given, make it a part of us. There is a rhythm in all things. The cycle of the year goes around again. The cycle of the Knowledge as well. Let us remember and re-learn the knowledge given in the previous cycle. </P>
        <P>Option 3. Grace and Gratitude </P>
        <P>"To those who have, more will be given. To those who have not, even what little they have will be taken away from them. " </P>
        <P>How much gratitude have we had for the Knowledge that has been given each week? How much have we valued the Knowledge Faxes? How much awareness, how much attention have we put on them? Have they become just another routine, something else to take for granted? Wherever we put our attention, that will increase. Have we not put enough attention on the Knowledge Sheets each week?</P>
        <P>Option 4. Silence </P>
        <P>Truth is beyond words. Therefore whatever we speak is false. Only in silence can we know the Truth. Only in silence can we be the Truth. </P>
        <P>Meditate. Be silent. Know thy Self. </P>
        <P>Option 5. The Unbaked Pot </P>
        <P>When you pour water into an unbaked pot, the water is wasted, and so is the pot. Before you put water into a pot, you should bake the pot. The Guru is now baking all the pots. When they are baked, then he will be able to fill them with the water of Knowledge. But for now, why waste all that good water? </P>
        <P>Objection: But how can the pots be baked without the Fire of Knowledge? </P>
        <P>This is a very good point. I suppose there are other fires. The fire of criticism and humiliation; the fire of hunger; the fire of lust; the fire of longing; the physical fire of heat. You should ask the Guru to speak on the five fires. </P>
        <P>Option 6. The Answer to Last Week's Non-riddle </P>
        <P>Look for the meaning hidden in all the events. And a non-event is also an event. There was a "sandesh" contained within the box of Sandesh sweets given to the Guru last week. Similarly, what is the meaning hidden in this week's non-fax?</P>
        <P>"Let those who have ears hear." Hearing the silence. This is what we must do. </P>
        <P>Option 7. Just Testing </P>
        <P>The Guru is testing our level of dismay at not receiving a fax this week. It seems that the level of dismay was appropriately high, as it now appears a fax has indeed been sent, albeit belatedly. (I just called Bill Hayden. Poor Bill. Apparently a good proportion of the people on the continent also called him.) </P>
        <P>So what to read into this? Possibility: The Guru is soft-hearted, he cannot bear our disappointment. Or: The Guru is disappointed. We did not receive the silent fax he sent; so he was obliged to send a fax containing words. Or: The Guru is pleased. Our collective dismay at not receiving a fax this week proved to him that we do deeply value the Knowledge given each week and we are extremely grateful or ? ? ?</P>
       
        <P>P.P.S. The above Knowledge Fax Supplement was sent by Susannah and the Ottawa Satsang group on 21st September regarding Knowledge Fax #67. </P>

    <P>People who are free, regret that they don't have discipline. They keep promising that they will become disciplined. People who are disciplined look for the end. (Discipline is not an end in itself, it is a means.)</P>
    <P>Look at the people who have no discipline; they are miserable. Freedom without discipline is absolute misery. Discipline without freedom is suffocating.</P>
    <P>Orderliness is monotonous and chaos is stressful.</P>

    </B><P>The big advanced course at the ashram of Kripalu Maharaj (the founder of Kripalu Yoga) at Kayavaran in India brought celebration to the ashram. It was all so well organized that there were no complaints and no one felt lost in the big group. There was one teacher taking care of every 25 people. People were sharing so many miraculous stories.</P>
    <P>The outdoor Satsangs in the moon light and Christmas lights simply transformed the place into Brindavan. On the last evening, Guruji appeared in pink silks and was adorned with a crown of beautiful flowers and a peacock feather. Guruji received 400 garlands from devotees. Each garland that hung around Guruji's neck, when being removed took a few hairs with it.</P>
    <P>This was a course that started in bliss and ended in chaos. Even though people thought there was no chaos, an impatient aeroplane left Guruji behind after the course, whereas the next plane in the next city and after a three-hour drive, graciously took Him and His group as the last passengers. The race did not end until He boarded His international connecting flight -- again as the last passenger . . . </P>

      </B><P>German Ashram had an intense Teachers Training Course. Guruji went up to Minsk and Belarus, where people had come from as far as Siberia. As many people met Guruji for the first time, it was like a dream come true for them. Virtually everybody had a miraculous experience to tell. One family had spent 7 months salary to come to meet Guruji. Another family sold their house to meet Gurudev. Over 1000 people filled the stadium and the auditorium looked splendid and all the teachers had worked hard to make the stadium look splendid and magnificent. People from Lithuania, St. Petersburg, Moscow, Minsk, and many other towns had gathered in a very festive mood. Russian television covered Guruji's arrival in Mumbai. There was a grand reception for Guruji. When he sat on his seat, all the flowers over him seemed to reach out for his Darshan. It seemed as if there was a waterfall of flowers and Guruji was smiling in the center. In the evening, Guruji was presented with two flowers, with which he played around for hours and kept posing for photographs. The conversation was diverted to the lotus flowers.</P>

    <P>Q: Many ask for blessings but only a few will receive it.  Why?</P>

    <P>A: The giver is anyway giving but the taker is not there - the sincerity is missing.  One who gives blessings gives it freely but the one who receives it has to be sincere.  Sincerity is the qualification to receive blessings.  And everyone is free to be sincere at any point of time or space.</P>
    
    <P>Q: Why do people choose to be sincere only sometimes?</P>
    
    <P>A: Because of the illusion that they are going to miss some mundane pleasure.  Hankering after pleasure makes them insincere.  When you are sincere you simply enjoy pleasure.</P>
    
    <P>Poor people fight for food.  Rich people share their food.  Richer are those people who share power.  Richer still are those who share fame.  Richest are those who share themselves.  Richness of a person is indicated by his ability to share and not by what he hoards.  Godliness is enjoying sharing fame.</P>

      <P>In the Ashram some people wanted white bread to be served at breakfast.  Some were opposed to this and it caused a big conflict (laughter) because they couldn't find any other reason to be in conflict.  Just one phone call from Guruji set everyone in astonishment.</P>
      
      <P>The diplomatic reception, the piles and piles of flower and the smiling crowd at the airport was a great part of the Taipei event.  Guruji addressed a group of medical professionals in the afternoon and an interfaith conference attended by many religious leaders in the evening.  An advanced course followed on the hilltop retreat center.  The experiences of the people were great.  One lady in her mid-thirties had been in a wheelchair and could not walk for several years.  She started walking after she met Guruji on the previous advanced course.  On the last day of the course, Sharmila and Guruji cooked for 20 volunteers who stayed back to clean up, and you know what?  When dinner was served, 60 people showed up!  All were fed with the food left over.</P>
      
      <P>Amid tears and laughter the party moved</P>
      <P> on to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  The honorable Minister for Works was present at the official launching of the Malaysian Art of Living Society.  Several prominent leaders came to take blessings from Guruji.  One of them asked, &quot;What is the limit of want?&quot;  Guruji said, &quot;Unhappiness.&quot;  It was a colorful evening with Satsang and dinner.  The lights of the local TV stations were so powerful that the circuit breakers switched off twice!</P>

    <P>For your prayer to be answered, the desire has to be intense.  The greater the intensity of desire and the later it gets fulfilled, then greater will be the gratitude. </P>

    <P>lntense desire leads you to devotion.  For desire to get intense, time and the need for the desire are required.  The feeling of gratitude is so overwhelming after the fulfillment of desire that it's achievement loses its charm and significance. </P>
    
    <P>The son of a farmer in India had a life-long desire to go to England and he prayed deeply for it.   Even the news of his trip to England materializing filled him with immense gratitude -- he did not even care whether he went or not. </P>
    
    <P>Often people think that they are unfortunate if their desires don't get fulfilled quickly.  lntense desire can frustrate you or make you prayerful.  In prayerfulness, there is gratitude and devotion.  Any intense experience makes you whole. </P>

    <P>Guruji and his entourage moved from Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok.  Once again the metal detector beeped.  Guruji gave a fiery Satsang to a multi-ethnic audience.  It has made teachers busy for the next whole month. </P>
    
    <P>With Guruji's arrival, the City of Joy (Calcutta) was overjoyed.  Hoardings and banners all over the city created a stampede at the magnificent GD Birla Sabhaghar city auditorium.  But with the pervading bliss inside, everthing fell into place.  The garden of Bharti and S.B. Ganguly was respendent with lights and melody -- The birds in the garden, the flowers, the decorations (not forgetting Bengali sweets), and smiling faces everywhere.</P>
    
    <P>The pact of cooperation was signed by the Satsangees and the mosquitoes at the Nalban Park Salt Lake which was the venue for the next Satsang in Calcutta on the banks of the lake on a moonlit night.  The team work at Calcutta that was in evidence all through was superlative.</P>

      <P>It is only through merit that you can have faith.  When you lack faith, happiness is neither in the inner nor the outer world.  Happiness springs forth from faith.  Happiness is forgetting the body consciousness.  Pain or sorrow is holding on to the body consciousness.  Whenever you are happy you don't feel the body and when you are miserable, you have aches and pains.</P>

      <P>Question: Then why in meditation is the attention taken to various parts of the body?</P>
      
      <P>Guruji: For an arrow to go forward, you have to pull it back.  In the same way when you take the attention to the various parts of the body, it frees you from body consciousness.</P>

    <P>2. It indicates the amount of stress and insensitivity</P>
    <P>3. It projects the up-bringing of the person</P>
    <P>4. It indicates a behavioral pattern</P>
    <P>5. It shows lack of knowledge</P>
    <P>6. It shows lack of observation of one's own mind and its sensations</P>
    <P>7. It shows you behavior to avoid</P>
    <P>8. It is an opportunity for you to welcome and absorb the rudeness</P>
    <P>9. It strengthens your mind</P>
    <P>10. It unconditions the love that you are</P>
    
    <P>The next time when someone is rude to you, make sure you don't get upset.  Just give back a broad smile.</P>

    <P>Guruji came from Delhi for an overnight stay at the Ashram and left the next morning to Kerala.  Organizers in Delhi as well as in Cochin (Trivandrum and Trichur) had experienced very clearly the non-doership of the big event.  Everything fell in its space at the right moment as always.  Enthusiastic devotees in Cochin renovated their homes.  After Cochin, Guruji rushed to the colorful Trichur (In Trichur as usual there was chaos and asana-snatch).  Excellent team work and elaborate arrangements were appreciated by thousands who came to the Satsang.  The Kerala-style decorated elephants with umbrellas and the ballkas dressed in traditional attire carrying lights and flowers were a spectacular welcome.  Many people shared their amazing healing experiences.  Then the whole troop moved to Trivandrum, the town of infinity.  The king of Kerala received Guruji at the Senate Hall with a packed audience of 4000 people.  Colorful umbrellas, elephants, the traditional horns and drums and the Vedic chanting filled the air.  People were enraptured for a three and a half hour program.  The next morning newspapers were filled with the news of the Art of Living Satsang.</P>

He told Murli to take some medicine and tapped him on the throat.  Amazingly, Murli was cured in the next few minutes.  It was as though nothing had happened.  He did not listen to Guruji.  He did not even take any medicine.</P>
  
  <P>People came to the Advanced Course for silence and were blasted by loud raucous music from the local village.  People came all the way from Germany for the sunny weather for which Bangalore is known at this time of the year.  They got dreary clouds, chilling wind, and rain.  In addition, there were frequent power cuts which ensured that people took cold water baths in the morning.  GurujiÒ³ voice went hoarse and He needed a tap on His own throat!</P>

The seed is not perfect.  The sapling is not perfect.  It has to cease to be a sapling to become a tree.

<P>A person who cannot surrender cannot be self-reliant either.</P>

<P>If you don't have enough courage to surrender, then it is impossible  for you to be self-reliant.  You simply fool yourself.   People who are afraid to surrender fool themselves.   Because even a little fear is detrimental to self-reliance.</P>

<P>Self-reliance contains surrender.   Fifty dollars contains ten dollars.</P>

<P>When you want to depend on yourself for everything, there is nobody else, then it needs a lot of courage.</P>

<P>Often people think that surrender is a way to escape from  responsibility and they end up blaming the Divine for all their problems.   In fact, the  true surrender is taking total responsibility for everything.</P>

<P>Susannah:    How can we do that?</P>

<P>You take responsibility and you pray for help.</P>

An entourage of forty-five devotees traveled from Bangalore to Madras for the occasion.</P>

<P>India's warm December weather, bougainvillea and coconut palms have now been replaced by Switzerland's mist-shrouded Alpine peaks, snow-covered palms, and the swans on Lake Lucerne.</P>

    <P>Different organs of our body are governed by different devas. The solar plexus is connected with the sun, that's why it is called "solar" plexus. When the first rays of the sun fall on the solar plexus, it is very good for your body. Doing <I>Surya Namaskar</I> ("sun salutation") yoga asana in the early morning is very good. The solar plexus has a profound impact on the central nervous system, optic nerves, stomach, and what we usually call "gut feeling." It is the second brain in your body. Usually the solar plexus is slightly bigger than an almond. Studies have shown that with the practice of yoga, meditation, and Sudarshan Kriya, the solar plexus can become as a large as the size of the palm. Then it performs better. It balances the body functions. When the solar plexus expands, the intuitive mind works better. The mind becomes clear and focussed. When the solar plexus contracts, one feels horrible, sad, depressed, and all the negative feelings come.</P>
    <P>Krishna was called Padmanabha, meaning "whose navel is the size of a lotus flower." If you become Padmanabha, you become absolutely creative. Brahma, the Creator, is born out of a blossomed solar plexus.</P>
    <P>These days, the solar plexus remains small, but the tummy keeps getting bigger.</P>

When <I>Bhakti</I> is there the doubts don't come.  It gives the most energy.  So <I>Bhakti</I> contains as the seed all the four qualities.</P>

<P>All the emotional upheavals one undergoes is because one doesn't know <I>Bhakti</I>.  When all intense feelings flow in one direction that is <I>Bhakti</I>, it becomes <I>Bhakti</I>.  What is the difference between a canal and a flooded field?  In a flood what happens is the water does not have a bank to flow in.  When the water flows within banks you call it &quot;river&quot;.  When water is scattered all over, it's all flooded.  So when the emotions get flooded everywhere, mind is in a mess.  If it is intensely flowing in a direction, then that is <I>Bhakti</I>.  And that is most powerful.</P>

<P>A sign of Intelligence is Surrender or <I>Bhakti</I>.</P> 		</font>

<P>Guruji escaped from the Akademie Bad Antogast (German Ashram) for one day to meet with the World Health Organization at Geneva.  Then he completed the European Teacher's Refresher week, managing to meet with every group from every country represented before taking off for Trinidad.  There he was received at the airport by the Minister of Social Development, and met the following day with first the President of Trinidad and then the Prime Minister.  Guruji spoke to over-flowing crowds each evening.</P>

<P>Janael McQueen said that a Joytish (astrologer) had said many devotees would be enlightened in the next ten years.  Michael Fischman said, &quot;Oh, when it happens to you, give me a call!&quot;</P>

          <FONT FACE="Arial"><P>NEWS FLASH</B> Guruji's party made a lightening tour to Dominica and there was a program organized by the cabinet minister for education and social welfare. The Satsang group met in the airport VIP lounge on the way back during a stop over in St. Lucia (a Caribbean island). There was a diplomatic reception in Curacao (another island near Venezuela) and a big Satsang. For the first public talk there was a full house. On to Panama, where Martine and Dr. Chu hosted a large Satsang and then Shirley was the copilot of the small plane that took the group to the Panama Canal. Manu, from Hong Kong, is organizing courses all over Central and South America. Marjorie and her team organized a packed house for a great talk in Costa Rica. This trip gave a huge boost to the spreading of the knowledge throughout the Caribbean and Central America.</P>
    <B><P>Short story</B>: Guruji was walking along the beach with some devotees and there was a huge desalination plant (changes salt water to fresh water) costing millions of dollars. Nearby was a coconut tree. Guruji looked and pointed out that the tree is a natural desalination plant. It takes the salt water from the earth and makes the fresh water inside the coconut. The knowledge is like the tree -- it takes us from salty mud to the pure bliss.</P>
