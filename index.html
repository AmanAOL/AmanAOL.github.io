    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>THIS BEGINS A NEW PRACTICE</B></P>
    <P>This begins a new practice of weekly dispatches of Knowledge from Guruji. Every center around the world will receive the Knowledge so it can be read for people to copy down at weekly Satsang. Here is the first segment Guruji dictated at Big Sur, 21 June, 1995.</P>
    <P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * *</P>
    <P>Beyond an event is Knowledge.&#9;</P>
    <P>Beyond a person is love.</P>
    <P>Beyond an object is infinity.</P>
    <P>Knowledge is not in an event; it is beyond an event.</P>
    <P>If you take one event and infer anything from one event -- infer knowledge -- it will be erroneous knowledge. Say Nancy gets angry and shouts at someone. You attribute anger to Nancy, but actually it was carried from someone else to her. Someone else got angry first and someone else and someone else and on and on like that.</P>
    <P>When you go beyond an event, only then the truth dawns. One particular event gives you a false notion. So you have to consider the totality of events, the totality of all events infinitely. Beyond the event is Knowledge.</P>
    <P>What do we call a person? A person is a body, a mind, a complex of behaviors which is changing. Love is unchanging. Beyond the person is love.</P>
    <P>When you lose your personality, you become love. If you cannot lose yourself, you cannot find yourself. So, lose your personality; you'll find yourself!!!</P>
    <P>Behind every object is infinity. An object is limited. Take an object and reduce, reduce, reduce, and you have an atom. An atom is infinity. Each atom contains infinite space. Beyond the object is infinity.</P>
    <P>The object behind the object is infinity. The person behind the person is love.</P>
    <P>Maya is getting caught up in the event, personality, object. Knowledge, love, Brahman is seeing beyond the event, personality, or object. See? Just a little shift.</P>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>CLOSE TO THE MASTER</B></P>
    <P>If you're not feeling close to the Guru, it's because of you. Because of your mind, because of your ego concepts. Share with the Guru that which is very important or intimate to you. Share that. Do not feel shame, shy, or judgmental about yourself. </P>
    <P>Unless you express to the Master that which is very intimate and important to you, just being on the formal and informal communication levels cannot make you feel close. "How are you, where are you going? How have you been?" Stop formal and superficial conversations with the Master and speak with your heart that which is very important and intimate, very deep to your life. Don't just say how much the squash costs, 30 cents or whatever.</P>
    <P>If you don't feel close to the Master, there's no point in having a Master. It is just another burden to you. You have enough already. Just say "Goodbye," get rid of it.</P>
    <P>Question: When you play little games and push us away, how can we feel close to you?</P>
    <P>Answer: You should feel more close if you are pushed away, scolded or ignored. Because to ignore somebody takes a lot of effort. When a Master does not even ignore wrapping paper, or a flower that is in a vase, how can he ignore a walking, talking, breathing human being who is connected? How could that be ignored? So when you understand this, you already feel close.</P>
    <P>Question: Can we call you every week?</P>
    <P>Response from the room: Call Guruji every week and if he doesn't answer the phone then you know you are loved.</P>
    <P>Answer: Yes, put that in. &#9;(Laughter)</P>
    <P>You are with the Master to share the joy of the Master, to share the consciousness of the Master. For that, you have to empty your cup of what is already in it. So you share that with the Master. You share whatever you have and don't judge, "Oh, that is garbage." The Master is ready to accept any garbage of any extent. However you are, he will embrace you. He is ready to share. You only have to share from your side.</P>

    <P>Some karma can be changed and some cannot.</P>
    <P>When you prepare halwa, if sugar is less or ghee is less, water more or less, it can all be adjusted, repaired. But once soji is cooked, it cannot be reversed.</P>
    <P>If the buttermilk is sour, milk can be added, salt can be added to make it drinkable. But it can never be reversed back to milk.</P>
    <P>Prabdha karma cannot be changed. Sanchita karma can be changed by spiritual practices. Satsang burns the seed of all negative karma.</P>
    <P>When you praise someone, you take on their good karma. When you blame someone you take on their bad karma.</P>
    <P>Know this and surrender both good and bad karma to the Divine and be free.</P>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>ONLY SPEAK KNOWLEDGE</B></P>
<P>Only speak Knowledge. Don't repeat anything that someone tells you or opinions about anyone that someone states -- "That so-and-so said such-and-such about you." If someone comes to tell you such things, discourage them. Don't believe it. </P>
<P>If someone blames you directly, know that they are taking away your bad karma and let it go. Don't believe in it, and if you're one of the Guru's close ones, you will take all of the blame of the world with a smile. </P>
<P>Conflict is the nature of the world; comfort is the nature of the self. Amidst the conflict seek the comfort. </P>
<P>When you are bored with the comfort, get into the games of the world. When you are tired of the games of the world, get into the comforts of the Self. If you are one of the Guru's close ones, you do both simultaneously. Trying to end conflict prolongs it. Face the conflict by seeking the comfort of the Self. </P>
<P>God is alive in the world and has been putting up with all the ongoing conflicts throughout the ages. If God can put up with all the conflicts, you can too. The moment you agree to be with the conflict, the conflict disappears.</P>
<P>People who love peace do not want to fight, and those who fight do not love peace. Those who want peace want to run away. What is needed here is to be peaceful within and then fight. The whole message of the Gita is to be peaceful yourself and then fight. Krishna tells Arjuna to fight but be in peace at the same time. Does this ring a bell?</P>
<P>In the world, you resolve one conflict and another one comes up. For example, Russia is solved and then Bosnia arises. You make one better, and then another starts up. Your body gets a cold, then you get better; then your back hurts, then it gets better. Your body gets better, and then the mind goes. The world runs like this, isn't it?</P>
<P>Without any intention, misunderstandings happen. It's not up to you to try to resolve them. Ignore them and be alive.</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>MASTER IS A DOORWAY</B></P>
      <P>Master is a doorway. And the doorway needs to be more charming than the world so that you will come to the doorway. Someone is in the street and there is rain, thunder, hot sun; they need shelter. They look around, they find a doorway. They come to the doorway. The doorway is more inviting, more charming, more celebrative, more joyful than anything else in the world.</P>
      <P>Nothing could give that much peace, joy, pleasure in the world. Once you come to the doorway, you enter the door and see the world from there. See the world from the eyes of the Master. This is a sign that you have come to the Master. Otherwise you may still be standing in the street and looking at the door. </P>
      <P>But once you have entered the door, then you will see the whole world from the eyes of the Master. This means what? In every situation that you face, you will think, "If this situation comes in front of the Master, how would he handle it?" or "How would she handle it?" "If this complication comes in front of the Master, how would he take it?" "If someone blames the Master like this, how would he handle it?" See the world from the eyes of the Master all the time.</P>
      <P>The world looks much more beautiful; not a nasty place. But a place filled with love, filled with joy, cooperation, compassion, and all virtues. The world is much more fun. Looking through the doorway, there is no fear. You will look at the world without any fear. You will be in all relationships with everybody without any fear. Because there is shelter. </P>
      <P>From inside home, you will look at the thunder, you will look at the storm, you will look at the rain, you will look at the bright sun. Inside you have air conditioning. Very cool, pleasant. Outside it's hot. You donÒ´ mind because there is nothing that can really distract you, disturb you, or take the fullness away from you. Such a sense of security, such a sense of fullness and joy comes. That is the purpose of having a Master.</P>
      <P>All relationships in the world go topsy-turvy. You make relationships and you break relationships. All relationships can get broken or made up and again broken. And there is craving and aversion. This is the world. This is samsara.</P>
      <P>But the Master is not a relationship. The Master is the Presence. What is necessary is to feel the Presence of the Master, not to make a relationship. Don't make the Master a part of your world. Then the same, "Oh, he looked at me." "He didn't look at me." "Oh, he said this." "He didn't say that." "Oh, somebody is close. I am not close." All this garbage comes into it. You feel the Presence of the Master, that is eternal. That has been there with you before, now, and will be there in the future, too.</P>
      <P>Master is the Presence. World is relativity. And relativity has limitations. Presence is unlimited. Presence is vast, infinite, and all comprehensive, all inclusive. And the presence of the Master in one's life will bring fulfillment to all relations. Every relationship will become complete with the presence of the Infinity if the Master is in your life. </P>

      </B><P>A doubt is a gray area. Gray is something which is neither white nor black. Now, how to solve the doubt? An event, knowledge, convention cannot help. Then what can help? Accepting it either as black or as white. Put it either as black and accept it or as white and accept it -- whether or not it is black or white. And see the gray as a shade of black or white. Either way you accept it. Honest or dishonest -- accept it. Then the mind is quiet. You are not in the gray area.</P>
      <P>See, the eyes are dark, eyebrows are dark, the thymus -- the most powerful organ of the body -- is black. Hemoglobin -- the main force of the body -- is black. You cannot survive without black. It is part of you.</P>
      <P>Or see it as white. Eye is also white. Bones are white; the structure on which the whole body stands is white. Put it in a category of black -- no problem -- accept. Put it in a category of white -- no problem -- doubt is not there. Have conviction. "I accept. They are dishonest and still part of me." That's it. Finished.</P>
      <P>Doubt is wanting to get rid of something. Doubt is a temporary state. Neither up nor below. There tension arises.</P>

        </B><P>&nbsp;The senses are like fire. Your life is also like fire. In the fire of senses, whatever you put in burns. If you burn tires, it creates pollution and bad smell. But if you burn sandalwood, it creates fragrance. </P>
        <P>&nbsp;Celebration happens around the bonfire. Grief happens around the fire of cremation. The same fire that supports life in winter, can also destroy. One fire, like a ghee lamp, lights your way and purifies. Another fire made of toxic material creates pollution. </P>
        <P>&nbsp;You are also like fire. Are you the fire that creates smoke and pollution or the flame of camphor which creates light and fragrance? A saint is like a camphor flame that creates light and the fragrance of love. He is the friend of life.</P>
        <P>&nbsp;The fire that creates light and warmth and is useful is of higher quality. The fire that creates light and a little smoke as well is of medium quality. The fire that creates darkness and only smoke is of low quality. Learn to distinguish the different fires. If your senses are engaged in goodness, then you will create light and fragrance. If engaged in impurity, you create smoke and darkness. It is <I>samyama</I> that transforms the quality of fire in you. Next week we will discuss <I>samyama</I>. </P>

            <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>HABITS AND VOWS</B></P>
          </B><P>&nbsp;How to get rid of <I>vasanas</I> (impressions)? This is a question for all those who want to come out of habits. </P>
          <P>&nbsp;You want to get rid of habits because they give pain and restrict you. The nature of <I>vasana</I> is to bother you, or bind you, and wanting to be free is the nature of life. Life wants to be free and when a soul doesn't know how to be free, it wanders through lifetimes wanting freedom.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;The way to come out of habits is vows. This is <I>samyama</I>. Everybody is endowed with a little <I>samyama</I>. </P>
          <P>&nbsp;A vow should be time bound. This would bring good conduct and save you from being wayward. Consider the time and place for vows to be taken.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;When the mind dwells on useless thoughts, then two things happen. One is that all those old patterns come up and you feel discouraged by them. You blame yourself and feel that you have not made any progress. </P>
          <P>&nbsp;The second thing is that you see it as an opportunity for <I>samyama</I> and feel happy about it. Without <I>samyama,</I> life will not be happy and diseases arise. For example, you know you should not eat three servings of ice cream, or eat ice cream every day, or otherwise you will get sick.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;Habits will clog you when there is no liveliness or juice in life. When there is a direction for life force, you can rise above habits through <I>samyama.</P>
          </I><P>&nbsp;Take vows according to time and place. For example, suppose someone has a habit of smoking cigarettes and says, "I will quit smoking," but cannot do it. They can take a vow, three months or 90 days; a time-bound vow. If someone is used to cursing and swearing, take a vow not to use bad language for ten days. Don't take it for a lifetime; you will break it immediately. If you happen to break it in between, don't worry. Just begin again. Slowly increase the duration until it becomes your nature.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;All those habits which bother you, bind them in vows, in <I>samyama</I>. So all those who are in Satsang, take a time-bound vow today and make a note of it. If you break a vow, make a note of it and share the time and date at the next Satsang. Continue it again. Tie those habits which bring you pain in <I>samyama</I>.</P>

            </B><P>&nbsp;How to get rid of <I>vasanas</I> (impressions)? This is a question for all those who want to come out of habits. </P>
          </B><P>&nbsp;When someone blames you, what do you usually do? Blame them back or you put up resistance in yourself. When someone blames you, they actually take away some negative karma from you. If you understand this and don't put up resistance and feel happy about it, then you drop your resistance. "Oh, good. That person is blaming me. Good. Something is going away." And when you drop the resistance, your karma goes away. Do you see what I'm saying? </P>
          <P>&nbsp;So when someone blames you and you put up resistance in your mind, and you don't react, then you are not allowing them to take the negative karma. Outside you may resist, but inside if you don't resist, and feel happy, "Oh, good, somebody is there to blame me and take some negative karma," you will feel immediately lighter.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;How does it feel to you when someone blames you? Do you feel some heaviness? Usually, when someone blames you, you feel hurt and you feel unhappy, you feel sad. This is all because you're . . . resisting. That is it. What you resist, persists. The ignorant person tells someone, "Don't blame me because it hurts me."</P>
          <P>&nbsp;An enlightened person also says "Don't blame me." Do you know why? Because it might hurt you. This is a beautiful point. What are the points? You get hurt because you resist the blame. When someone blames you, you resist it inside. Outside you may not resist, but inside when you resist, then that hurts you.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;An ignorant person warns you, "You better not hurt me, you better not blame me because I will feel hurt." Someone warns you not to blame them because it will hurt them and they'll do something harmful to you out of revenge.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;An enlightened person says "Don't blame me because it will hurt you." So here you say, don't blame because of compassion. You can tell someone, don't blame me out of compassion, or you can say it out of anger.</P>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>TODAY IS KRISHNA'S BIRTHDAY</B></P>
    <P ALIGN="CENTER">&#9;&#9;BIRTH OF THE CENTER OF ATTRACTION</P>
  </B><P>&nbsp;Krishna means the most attractive . . . It is the divinity that is the most attractive; the energy that pulls everything to it. Krishna is the formless center which is everywhere. Any attraction from anywhere is coming only from Krishna. Often people fail to see the spirit behind the attraction and merely hold on to the outer shell. And the moment you try to possess the shell, you will see Krishna has played a trick and you will be left with an empty shell in your hands and tears in your eyes.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;Be clever like Radha -- don't be tricked by Krishna. Krishna could not escape from Radha, for her whole world was filled with Krishna. If you can see that wherever there is an attraction, there is Krishna; then you are Radha, you are in your center.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;The mind moves towards beauty, joy and truth. Krishna tells Arjuna, "I am the beauty in the Beautiful, the strength in the Strong, the wisdom in the Wise." In this way he arrests the mind from moving away from him.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;Krishna reveals this Knowledge to Arjuna because he is <I>Anasuya</I>. Next week we will see what is <I>Anasuya</I>.</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>ANASUYA</B></P>
    </B><P>&nbsp;Knowledge will be different at different levels of consciousness. At a particular level of consciousness you will become <I>anasuya</I>. <I>Anasuya</I> is devoid of fault-finding eyes. If a mirror is dusty, you need a duster to clean it. But if your eyes have a cataract, any amount of dusting will not help. So first you have to remove the cataract. Then you can see that the mirror is already clean.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;There is a certain mind set that always finds fault, even in the best conditions in the world. When you give a person with this mind set the best, they still find faults. Even with the best possible companion, or the most beautiful painting, they will still find something wrong. That kind of mind set cannot know the sacred Knowledge. Krishna tells Arjuna that he is giving him the Royal Secret, because he is <I>anasuya</I>. "You are not finding fault in Me, even though you are so close."</P>
    <P>&nbsp;From a distance, even craters cannot be seen. Even on a smooth surface there will be holes. If you are only interested in the holes, you will not see the magnanimity of things. If you are not in <I>anasuya</I>, Knowledge cannot blossom in you. Then there is no point in giving Knowledge. </P>
    <P>&nbsp;Question: What about discrimination -- Wisdom?</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Answer: If it is in your vision, your vision will find discrimination. The moment you are out of the path, everything is all wrong, that is not <I>anasuya</I>. For example, you have a friendship, and after 10 years you decide to leave. When you leave, you do not see the good in that relationship. You find fault. This is not <I>anasuya</I>.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;However, once you discover you have the wrong vision, half of the wrong vision has already disappeared. There is a fine line here. There cannot be any better example than the cataract. Instead of saying, "My vision is blurred," you say, "The whole world is not sharp." Suppose someone is coming in. It is windy, so you shut the door. But the person thinks the door has been slammed in his face! This is <I>asuya</I>. It is not <I>anasuya</I>. Most of the population is like this.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;<I>Asuya</I> is finding fault. It is seeing malicious intent everywhere. It is like a child who says, "Mother, you don't love me!" The child's vision is wrong. If the mother does not love the child, who will? It is the same as if someone comes and says, "Guruji, you don't love me!" If I don't love them, forget about it. Nobody else in the world will! Where else will they find love? Nowhere. A mother may get frustrated but not a Master.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Question: It seems as though you can't have <I>anasuya</I> unless you are enlightened?</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Answer: Not always. This is an excuse. To get enlightenment, you must have this vision.</P>

        <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>THE LOVE OF THE IGNORANT AND THE ANGER OF THE ENLIGHTENED</B></P>
      </B><P>&nbsp;The love of the ignorant can be harmful yet even the anger of the Enlightened is not harmful. It can be only good!</P>
      <P>&nbsp;An example is the school at the Art of Living Ashram in Bangalore. 250 children are enrolled but only 200 come to class on any given day. Fifty children don't show up. Why? They cry at home, "Mother, I don't want to go to school."</P>
      <P>&nbsp;The mother says, "Oh, la la, don't cry . . . ok." She thinks, "No child in the world is like my child." And so she sticks up for the child and begins to speak for him. She does not see the teacher's point of view. The mother asks the teacher, "Why are you not teaching my child properly? He is so innocent, so lovely." So, what happens -- the child grows up spoiled. The love in the mother's ignorance has spoiled the child. The child will never learn the alphabet, never learn to read or write, but the mother says, "Oh, never mind, there are sheep to look after and fields to tend." The mother's love in ignorance has spoiled the child.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;The anger of the Enlightened is a blessing. There are many instances of this in the <I>Puranas</I>. Once a Master was traveling in the middle province of India with a disciple following him a few yards behind. Some boys who were rude, rough, and abusive began to throw stones and tease the disciple calling him names. This went on for some time as the boys followed the Master and the disciple. They came to a river. The Master and the disciple got into a boat in order to cross. The boys got in another boat which started to sink in the middle of the river.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;The Master slapped the disciple across the face. The disciple was so surprised as he had not said a word back to the boys in response to their taunts. He had been such a good disciple and yet the Master had slapped him!</P>
      <P>&nbsp;The Master said, "It is your fault. You are responsible for their boat sinking. You did not respond to their abuse. Nature has now punished them in a worse way because you did not have enough compassion to quell their insults."</P>
      <P>&nbsp;The slap that the Master gave took away the karma of this event such that it would not be carried into the future of the boys. It also served to take away any little bit of joy the disciple may have felt at seeing the boys' boat sink! Thus, it also took away the karma of the event for the disciple. So, the anger of the Enlightened is a blessing!</P>

  </B><P>&nbsp;You know there is a Big Mind and a small mind. Sometimes the Big Mind wins over the small mind and sometimes it is the other way around. </P>
  <P>&nbsp;When the small mind wins over, it is misery and when the Big Mind wins, it is joy. </P>
  <P>&nbsp;Small mind promises joy and leaves your hand empty. Big Mind may bring resistance in the beginning but fills you with joy.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;The word <I>Guru </I>means great. <I>Jaya</I> means victory. <I>Deva</I> means one who is fun-loving, playful, light. One who is playful is often not dignified and when one is dignified, he is often not playful. </P>
  <I><P><font face ="Arial" size="2"> <b> Jai Guru Dev </b> </font></I> is victory to the Big Mind in you that is both dignified and playful. That is what <I><font face ="Arial" size="2"> <b> Jai Guru Dev </b> </font></I> means: "Victory to the Greatness in you." </P>
  <P>You do not say victory or hail to the Master as he has won over already. You say victory to your own Self, your own Mind, which is being veiled by the small mind.</P>

      <P>&nbsp;When you forget this you become sad. Sorrow indicates </P>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>FREEDOM AND DISCIPLINE</B></P>
  </B><P>Freedom and discipline are opposites and complementary. The purpose of defense is to protect freedom. But is there freedom in defense? Do soldiers have freedom? No, they are totally bound, not even allowed to put the right foot down when told the left foot. Their steps are measured and they are unable even to walk with a natural rhythm. There is total lack of freedom in defense. That which has absolutely no freedom is protecting the freedom of the country! So it is with the police; they protect the freedom of the individual. But are they free?</P>
  <P>Discipline protects freedom. They both go hand in hand. Understand this and go ahead in life. You have some restrictions and it is this that allows you freedom. You can choose to focus either on freedom or discipline, and this makes you happy or unhappy. Freedom without discipline is like a country without a defense.</P>
  <P>Fences should be fences; a fence cannot be built all over the property. If your fence is all over, how can you build on the property? That state of high absolute freedom is too difficult; we need to be very practical. Yes, there is a state of unlimited bliss, the freedom Advaita talks about. The Advaita Knowledge has been totally misused or used according to one's own fancies and conveniences.</P>
  <P>There must be awareness in the mind, love in the heart, and righteousness in action.</P>
  <P>Love and fear are two possibilities that put you on track. The Jewish religion put fear as the main thing so that life could improve. Nature induces fear at a certain age in a child. When a child is very young, it gets 100 percent time and love of the mother. The child has no fear. As the child grows more independent it becomes cautious. Nature brings in an iota of fear. With freedom, the child starts walking carefully. Fear of losing freedom also brings defense. The purpose of defense is to eliminate fear.</P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>On this path Knowledge is your Freedom<BR>and also your Defense.</B></P>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>SAKHA -- YOUR RELIABLE SENSE</B></P>
    
  <P>&nbsp;There are three things: the Self, the senses, and the object, or the world. And there are three words: <I>sukha</I>, pleasure; <I>dukha</I>, sorrow; and <I>sakha</I>, companion. These have one thing in common: "kha," which means "senses."</P>
  <P>&nbsp;The Self through the senses experiences the world. When the senses are with the Self, that is pleasure (<I>sukha</I>), because the Self is the source of all joy or pleasure. When the senses are away from the Self (<I>dukha</I>) -- in the mud, lost in the object -- that is misery. Mud, misery, mind -- they are very close.</P>
  </FONT><FONT FACE="BernhardMod BT" SIZE=5><P>Self &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senses ("Kha")&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; World</P>
  <P>---&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy (Sukha)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorrow (Dukha)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--- </P>
  </FONT><FONT FACE="BernhardMod BT"><P>Self is the nature of joy. In any pleasant experience, you close your eyes; you smell a nice flower, or you taste or touch something. So<I> sukha</I> is that which takes you to the Self. <I>Dukha</I> is that which takes you away from the Self. Sorrow simply means that you are caught up in the object, which goes on changing, instead of focussing on the Self.</P>
  <P>All the sense objects are just a diving board to take you back to the Self.</P>
  <I><P>Sa-kha</I>, companion, means: "He <B><I>is</B></I> the senses." <I>Sakha</I> is one who has become your senses, who is your senses. If you are my senses, it means I get Knowledge through you; you are my sixth sense. As I trust my mind, so I trust you. A friend could be just an object of the senses, but a <I>sakha</I> has become the very senses.</P>
  <P>The <I>sakha</I> is the companion who is there in both the experiences of the <I>dukha</I> and of <I>sukha</I>. It means one who leads you back to the Self. If you are stuck in an object, that wisdom which pulls you back to the Self is <I>sakha</I>.</P>
  <P>Knowledge is your companion and your companion is Knowledge. And the Master is nothing but the embodiment of Knowledge. So<I> sakha</I> means, "He is my senses, I see the world through that wisdom, through Him."</P>
  <P>If your sense is the Divine, then you see the whole world through the Divinity.</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>SCEPTICISM</B></P>
      
      <P>&nbsp;Ignorance is being a sceptic and not knowing you are a sceptic. If you think you are a sceptic, you are no longer a sceptic because you have a clue of something beyond. So, in reality, you can never know whether you are a sceptic or not!</P>
      <P>&nbsp;A sceptic is stuck in a paradigm and closes all other possibilities. But this creation is of all possibilities. As one understands the paradigm shift, scepticism is removed.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;A real scientist can never afford to be a sceptic because scepticism closes down possibilities and does not continue to probe into unknown areas of existence. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;In short, scepticism is an "I know it all" attitude, and this attitude is unscientific. Scepticism is dispelled by Knowledge. Perception and inference are two means of knowing.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;In every human being deep inside, there is faith and love. What you think is scepticism is only a thin layer. If you hold in your mind that they are sceptics you empower their scepticism. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;Do not recognize someone's scepticism and try to argue with them. Argument strengthens their scepticism. Fear of interference in one's freedom brings more resistance and causes scepticism.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;Your silence and the smile from your heart will dispel their scepticism. There is nothing better than silence to break scepticism. Silence means the quality of consciousness, not just keeping lips tight.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;Scepticism doesn't come up in children. It comes only with people who walk with boundaries. Children have no scepticism. They live in their fantasy world, a world of many possibilities. Their world is one of innocence, joy, beauty, and so much love.</P>

        <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>SHAUCHA AND ASHAUCHA</B></P>
        
        <P>&nbsp;When you are miserable, what has happened is that you have gone away from the Self. This is called <I>Ashaucha</I>. It means you have become unclean.</P>
<P>&nbsp;In India when someone dies, the close relatives are said to be <I>Ashaucha</I> for 10 days because they are very sad. They are impure because they have moved away from the self. After 10 days of just being with that experience and reading the Gita, being with the Knowledge and pulling themselves back into the Self, then it is called <I>Shaucha</I>. They have purged out the impurities that have come during events.</P>
<P>&nbsp;This keeps happening again and again in dealings in life. You become <I>Ashaucha</I> and you have to get back to<I> Shaucha</I>. Go deeper in to yourself, then real <I>Shaucha</I> happens.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<I>Shaucha's</I> benefits are clarity in the intellect, a pleasing mind, focused awareness in the mind, a say over the senses, and therefore eligibility to realize the Self.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<I>Shaucha</I> is disinterestedness in the tendencies of one's own senses and non-association with other people. If a tendency in your body arises just have the understanding, "Oh yes, here is this old familiar tendency coming up again. Come on, you have had this experience enough, and still the body is craving for it again." Disinterestedness in one's own body -- just an idea, a sort of distaste, and in one moment it changes.</P>
<P>Why do people love each other so much, have such an intimate relationship, and then fight? <I>Ashaucha</I> has happened. If you don't get distaste for the tendency of the senses then distaste for the object of the senses will come and you will blame the object.</P>
<P>&nbsp;When <I>Ashaucha</I> happens then come back to <I>Shaucha</I> quickly. Suppose you get drowned in any worldly aspect, just know this is <I>Ashaucha</I> . . . "That is why I am suffering misery." Then come back to <I>Shaucha</I>.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Your attraction or craving is only as long as you think someone is "other." When you think they are part of you or your Self, then the attraction dies out. That is why a husband or wife is not attracted to the partner but to someone else because the partner has already become a part of them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;When you realize everyone is part of your Self, you enjoy the whole world without a sense of craving.</P>

    <P>&nbsp;What is boredom? </P>
<P>&nbsp;A repetition without interest or love causes a monotonous state of mind; that is boredom. It overshadows the Self. </P>
<P>&nbsp;A practice or <I>abhyasa</I> is again a repetition whose purpose is to destroy the boredom and reunite with the Self. In this process the practice itself creates boredom and as you continue, it penetrates the boredom and destroys it once and for all. Whether the practice gives you joy or boredom, it must be continued. Only the practice or <I>abhyasa</I> can annihilate the Mind.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Self is Love and Love is always repetitive. That is why love letters are simply repetitive and there is no boredom there. If you are bored with yourself then how much more boring you would be for others. Root out the boredom in you through deep and continued meditation.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Wake up and Walk up.</P>

<P>&nbsp;Some of you have <I>Brahma shakti</I>. You may create well, but you may not be able to maintain. For example, you may make friends very fast, but it does not last long. </P>
<P>&nbsp;There are others who cannot create but are good at maintaining. For example, people have long lasting friendships but cannot make any new friends. In such cases, <I>Vishnu shakti</I> is dominant. </P>
<P>&nbsp;And then there are others who have more of <I>Shiva shakti</I>. They bring in new life or transformation or they can destroy the whole set up.</P>
<P>&nbsp;In <I>Guru shakti</I>, all three <I>shaktis</I> have blossomed fully. </P>
<P>&nbsp;So each of you first identify which <I>shakti</I> you have more of and aspire for <I>Guru shakti</I>. Guru makes a group but a group cannot make a Guru.</P>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>HOW TO MAINTAIN INTIMACY</B></P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;Intimacy often gets broken because of ego or your desire. What breaks intimacy?</P>

    <DIR>
    
    <P>&#9;Ego or taking a position</P>
    <P>&#9;Desire</P>
    <P>&#9;Taking intimacy for granted</P>
    <P>&#9;Finding imperfection in oneself or others</P>
    <P>&#9;Expectations</P>
    <P>&#9;Insensitivity or over sensitivity</P>
    <P>&#9;Lack of vivek or vairagya (lack of discretion or dispassion)</P>
    <P>&#9;Judgements</P>
    <P>&#9;Grumbling or lack of gratitude</P></DIR>
    
    
    <P>Dissolving into infinity is the way to maintain intimacy. Intimacy is dissolving into infinity. Dissolving into infinity brings you to the moment. Go beyond events. Dissolve into infinity, be in the moment, and look beyond the events. This is the way to maintain intimacy.</P>
    <P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * </P>
    <P>If you attend Satsang you don't get much; but if you don't, you lose a lot. Just to maintain where you are, what you are, you need to attend weekly Satsang. </P>
    <P>&nbsp;Now, start doing ten minutes of Satsang, sharing of the Knowledge with someone, anyone. You are so used to talking gossip. Now for two weeks, talk Knowledge, especially to those not coming to Satsang. Even on the phone -- suppose you can't find someone at seven o'clock; call someone on the phone and talk Knowledge for a couple of minutes: "What are you doing? What do you want? How can I help you?" Praise the Divine.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;This is an exercise. Every day for ten minutes, do individual Satsang and skillfully talk ten minutes of Knowledge. Say, "Everything is temporary, everything is changing." Speak some Knowledge on the changing nature of the world.</P>

Say, for example, you are riding a motorbike on a busy motor way and in front of you there is another vehicle emitting exhaust fumes. You have three options.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1. &#9;You can complain, somehow bear with it, and still follow the vehicle.</P>
<P>2. &#9;You can slow down or wait for some time to allow the vehicle to move far away from you.</P>
<P>3. &#9;You can use your skill, overtake the vehicle, and forget about it.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>As in the first case, most of you stick on the events and are miserable, like inhaling fumes throughout your journey.</P>
<P>In the second case, you don't get permanent relief, as another bigger vehicle might come in front of you. Like that, running away from events is not the permanent solution.</P>
<P>However, wise people use their skill and grow over the events. If the vehicle is in perfect condition, the skill is effective. Conditioning the vehicle is <I>sadhana</I> or practice. And skill is the grace of the Guru.</P>
<P>The mistakes that you have made in the past have made you humble; you need not make mistakes in the future to become humble.</P>

      <P>&nbsp;Pure water is like love, Knowledge is like detergent, mind is like cloth, and the body like the washing machine. If you put in mud instead of detergent, your clothes become dirtier than before.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;You will have to go on putting clothes in the washing machine to get them cleaned. And the process repeats again and again. Similarly you will have many more births until you stop repeating the mistakes that you have made.</P>

<P>&nbsp;How rich are you? Do you celebrate once a year? Once a month? Every day? If you celebrate every moment, you are the Lord of Creation.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Review the year while you celebrate. This is your homework. What did you do? What did you achieve? How useful were you this past year? Sit for an hour and think about every week, one minute per week, and see the year's growth in less than an hour. With a flower, on New Year's Day, offer the whole year to the Divine.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">SPREADING THE FRAGRANCE</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;During Satsang, Guruji opened a small nicely-wrapped present. It was a tiny bottle of jasmine perfume. He twisted off the cap and sniffed the lovely fragrance. Then he proceeded to pour a small amount on some paper which he waved in the air, wafting the scent to all corners of the hall. Everyone could then enjoy it.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Guruji explained that it is not enough simply to have the fragrance. We have to know how to spread it. Flowers have the fragrance, but it is the wind that comes and spreads it. In the same way, each one of us is wonderful within -- we are beautiful, caring, and loving. But we do not know how to spread the fragrance.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Satsang is that wind which comes and spreads this fragrance to everyone.</P>

      <P>&nbsp;<B>NEWS FLASH</P>
      </B><P>&nbsp;Guruji arrived for the first time on January 15th in the Croatian capital of Zagreb. As soon as we landed, Guruji was driven straight to one of the largest concert halls in Zagreb. Guruji first met with a group of over a hundred professionals including doctors and members of the press. A few hours later the hall was filled to capacity for his evening lecture. The national television station filmed the entire talk. Over 100 people waited outside unable to enter. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;Before addressing the large crowd Guruji went out to the lobby and greeted those who could not enter. His talk was exquisite and a soft feeling of grace and peace transformed the atmosphere. At the end of the lecture many still waited outside for over two hours to get a glimpse of Guruji.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;The next evening Guruji gave his first talk in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Hundreds crowded into the World Trade Center. Guruji was soon overloaded with flowers from the group. Guruji continued to talk for an hour and a half as the enthusiastic crowd would not let him finish. The atmosphere was charged with immense gratitude and celebration. The Art of Living groups in Croatia and Slovenia have done an excellent job.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;Guruji now flies off to New York for a television interview and then it's on to the advanced course in Hawaii!</P>

    <P>&nbsp;What type of time do you give the Divine? Usually you give the time that is leftover, when you have nothing else to do, when no guests are coming, there are no parties to go to, no nice movies to watch, no weddings to attend. Such time you give. This is not quality time. </P>
<P>&nbsp;Give quality time to the Divine. It will be rewarded. If your prayers are not answered it is because you have never given quality time. Give Satsang and meditation your highest priority. Give prime time to the Divine. You definitely will be rewarded.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * </P>
<P>&nbsp;Here in Hawaii there is a fun-filled course, for you know <I>God Loves Fun</I>. This has been followed with the long-awaited book, <I>Way of Grace</I>. Satsang is open to the public each evening. The huge waves of the Hawaiian shores cannot compete with the waves of bliss at Satsang. Guruji has brought out deep Knowledge from the most mundane questions. We are making efforts to bring these tapes to you soon.</P>

<P>&nbsp;A Hawaiian Princess, Owana, found herself wondering why she felt compelled to drive in circles around a hotel in Honolulu. Later she found out from a devotee that it was Guruji's hotel. The next night she was singing her deeply felt native Hawaiian songs at Punditji's feet.</P>
<P>&nbsp;On Sunday, a lady named Mary was spending the day at an ancient temple ruins. She had gone there to make an offering and to pray. Her prayer was to meet her spiritual teacher and be shown the way Home. On Monday, she met Punditji and instantly became devoted. </P>

</B><P>&nbsp;Question: God is all abundant, all full and we are connected to God. Then why are we in debt, except for some? Why do they have, and we don't have?</P>
<P>&nbsp;Guruji: Is it only money? You have abundance, yet at the same time, you are indebted. So how can both be true? How can you be indebted and at the same time have abundance?</P>
<P>&nbsp;Somebody says: An abundance of indebtedness!</P>
<P>&nbsp;Guruji: When you say you are indebted, that means you have received. Otherwise how can you be indebted? So be thankful for being indebted, because you have received. Those who have received should feel indebted. If you don't feel indebted, you cannot have abundance. So the more indebted you feel, the more abundance you have.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Question: When the disciples met Jesus, they were not very successful, did not catch very many fish. When they met Jesus, he told them exactly where to fish and that's when they got lots of fish and then they decided to follow Jesus. </P>
<P>&nbsp;(Laughter)</P>
<P>&nbsp;Guruji: Feel indebted. Feel gratitude. Then abundance comes. As long as you are wanting for abundance you get indebted. Feel indebtedness and gratitude, then abundance comes.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Abundance and indebtedness coexist. You think you are indebted, but you really are not. It is better to feel totally indebted, because every bit of what you have, doesn't belong to you, including your body. Then you are infinitely indebted for your body, for Knowledge, for things you have received, and for your own life. Then you bask in the abundance of the Creator.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Someone says: I feel very indebted. Thank you!</P>

  		<P>&nbsp;<B>NEWS FLASH</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;Just a week before Guruji's arrival, Raj woke up in the middle of the night in Loughborough. He thought that some light was coming from the clock. He looked at Guruji's picture and saw that light was coming from it. This light grew and filled the room. He made sure that there was no outside light left on. The divine light stayed on for about ten minutes.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Upholland, Lancashire held an advanced course in Guruji's presence.</P>
<P>Guruji gave a talk on Ayurveda and the Art of Living at the Liverpool Medical Institution. The hall was full to capacity with standing room only, attended by medical professionals. It was a brilliant talk, but Punditji did not think so! He thought it was very mundane! There was great enthusiasm, however.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Next, Guruji's entourage moved with luggage and cars at its own speed and proceeded to Stourbridge in the Midlands for a talk organized by Stourbridge Earth Mysteries. The talk was simply great! The entourage then moved on to London, arriving at 3 o' clock in the morning for "The UK Tired of Living Teacher's Meeting" with baggage, blankets, pillows, plastic bags, pots and pans, and the usual divine chaos!!</P>

    <P>&nbsp;In science you have knowledge first, and then faith follows.</P>
<P>In spirituality, faith comes first, and then Knowledge follows.</P>
<P>For example, the knowledge that pesticides and chemical fertilizers are good for plants came through science, and people had faith in it, and all over the world they were used. And then another knowledge came that they were not good and the faith shifted to organic farming. The same with antibiotics. </P>
<P>The knowledge brought faith, the knowledge changed, and then faith changed. The knowledge and faith of science is of "happening." In spirituality, faith is first and Knowledge comes later. Like Kriya, Yoga, and meditation -- first you have faith and then Knowledge follows. For example, if you do pranayama faithfully then you get the Knowledge of the prana; if your do your meditation faithfully, the Knowledge of consciousness follows. Even an illiterate, through faith, attains deep Knowledge.</P>
<P>Vinod: Human is the best composite material. (Laughter -- this is the NASA scientist mind.)</P>
<P>Punditji: Science considers even human as matter, and spirituality considers even earth as mother, even rivers and mountains as living beings.</P>
<P>Science regards life as matter and spirituality regards even matter as life.</P> 		</font>

The puja and Satsang transported everyone to another plane. As usual, laughter filled the corridors of the new Ashram. The big hall was already too small to the surprise of everyone! Our own spring water replaced Pepsi and Coke!</P>
<P>Then on to Copenhagen -- the capital of Denmark. It was a media event: people from TV, radio, and the newspaper were queuing into the hotel. The TV crew followed to the public talks which were packed and very lively.</P>
<P>Then the giggling gang moved on to Norway, but had left some luggage behind in the hotel. The flight was conveniently delayed, which was very unusual for SAS. Lakshmi had called Guruji the night before. Guruji had said we will arrive at the airport at exactly 12:15. It kept Lakshmi wondering and confused because it was almost one hour later than the original arrival time. And they all arrived on the dot at 12:15!</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>RESPECT</B></P>
      
      <P>&nbsp;Why do you respect someone? Because of their good qualities, isn't it? For example, positive qualities like honesty, wisdom, love, talents, behavior. But all these change in time. And when they do change, you lose respect. You only respect the greatness. </P>
<P>&nbsp;I have tremendous respect for each and every one. Not for their greatness or wisdom or talent, but for their very person. I respect everyone totally. So I can never lose respect for anybody, however they may be. One doesn't need to be great in order to be respected. Respecting the life makes you great. Don't look for respect from others; that makes you weak. Have respect for the self and no one can take your self-respect.</P>

    <P>&nbsp;From Norway and Sweden. Ingrid in her van, plastered with big posters of Guruji, caught the attention of the traffic. Posters were all over Oslo. Sheila made a poster war. </P>
    <P>&nbsp;Vinod and Ingrid turned a reluctant ambassador into an enthusiastic devotee, staying up all night reading the book "The Way of Grace."</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Adventure time: We all went to a ski simulator and then sledded three kilometers downhill. All the devotees tumbled down, all covered with snow and with frozen hands and feet. It was -10 C and everyone was wearing heavy winter clothes, but there was Guruji, sledding with sandals and shawl. He didn't get a speck of snow on Himself.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Stockholm, Sweden: A TV crew was waiting in the meditation hall to interview him. They asked him what he thought about the New Age, if the Art of Living was part of the New Age. A moment of silence passed and with a vivid smile he replied, "Age is always new."</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Another programme entitled "The Three Wise Men" was made with one of Sweden's most respected TV journalists for a major TV channel. The three wise men included Guruji and the Dalai Lama.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Evening talks were filled with humor, brilliant questions were asked, and laughter filled the air. All the "hard nuts" started popping like popcorn. As usual, the best talks are never recorded.</P>

    <P>All desires are for happiness. That is the goal of desire, isn't it? How often does your desire lead you to the goal? But have you thought about the nature of desire? It simply means tomorrow, and not now, isn't it? Joy is never tomorrow. It is always now. </P>
<P>How can you have desires when you are joyful? And how can you really be joyful now when you have desires? Desire appears to lead you to happiness. In fact it cannot. And that is why it is Maya. What do you say?</P>

  <P>Guruji arrived on the 28th in Bangalore without his baggage. And he said that is how he came to the World -- without any baggage!</P>
  <P>An advanced course at the Ashram with participants from all corners of India was conducted from the first to the fifth of March. The Ashram was bustling with activity. Despite a large number of young devotees, the course was unusually silent. </P>
  <P>The silence was broken with the boisterous celebration of <I>Holi</I> -- the festival of colors. </P>
  <P>We had Satsang in the open air. The sound of the drums and the beat of the heart were magical and brought laughter and tears together in everybody. The full moon was so full and everyone was soaked in bright colors.</P>

  		<B><P>NEWS FLASH</B> </P>
<P>Before Guruji arrived in Delhi, everything was meticulously planned and organized. When Guruji arrived, there was a spontaneous Satsang at the airport. Airport personnel and other passengers joined in. It was sparkling! The well-organized plans went haywire and the usual divine chaos followed. Everything was settled in a flash but the organizers were left holding the plans on paper!</P>
<P>There was an air of celebration at Saritha Vihar Satsang. The sweets and flowers made a carpet in the large hall that matched the fragrance of joy. At Karol Bagh, the next day, there was more than one reason for the authorities to raise their eyebrows -- stampede in the room, traffic jam on roads, and devotees forgetting their families in their eagerness to follow the "Gurumobile." Then on to Rishikesh and the teachers' refresher course. </P>
<P>Rishikesh. The lush green Himalayas all around -- in the front, the holy Ganges that roars, gurgles, and sometimes murmurs -- the sounds mingling with the chirping of the birds -- the call of the peacocks in the early morning -- the chiming of the temple bells at sunrise -- the chanting of Vedic hymns at all times. Dip in the cold waters -- everyone clad in shawls and sweaters on their way in -- and most reluctant to leave afterwards. Sitting with Guruji in the evening, watching the sunset. Electrifying Satsangs and discourses on Bhagwad Gita in Hindi by Guruji, transport everyone to a blissful, celestial experience. More about Rishikesh next week.</P>

<P>&nbsp;To this Guruji said, "If you hold onto the question how will you receive the answer? Give away the question to me and then you will find that you are in the answer. If your hands are holding onto the question, how will you receive the answer? Your hands are already full with the question."</P>

<P>&nbsp;Guruji is still in Rishikesh. 350 people arrived from all over India for the advanced course -- a hundred more than expected. The volunteers had to run around trying to arrange rooms in the ashrams. During Satsang, the hall was spilling over with participants whose faces radiated ecstasy in the presence of the Master. </P>
<P>&nbsp;It appeared that all the Gods from heaven came down to earth to the holy town of Rishikesh to bask in the glory of the Master. The powerful Himalayas and the divine Ganges echo the sounds of joy and the laughter of the devotees. </P>
<P>&nbsp;Today is Gudi Padwa and Ugadi --- the new year celebrated in many parts of India. All 350 devotees went for a dip in the holy Ganges at 4:30 a.m. with Guruji oblivious to the temperature of the river. This was a new start to the new year in the presence of the Divine. </P>
<P>&nbsp;The most renowned, 75-year old saint of Rishikesh, Swami Pragyanandji had a vision in which he saw Guruji as Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh with many arms. He then performed a puja to Guruji.</P>

      <P>When a worldly man is miserable, he blames the people around him, the system, and the world in general. </P>
<P>When a seeker is miserable he, of course, blames the world, but in addition he blames the path, the Knowledge, and himself. </P>
<P>It is better not to be a seeker so that you blame less. But then a seeker (<I>sadhak</I>) also enjoys everything much more. There is more love in life and more pain. When there is more joy, the contrast is greater. A certain level of maturity is needed to see things as they are and not to blame the path, the self, and the world. Do you see what I am saying?</P>
<P>It is like a quantum leap. If one jumps across this threshold then there is no fall.</P>
<P>The Divine does not test you. Testing is part of ignorance. </P>
<P>Who will test? One who does not know will test, isn't it? God knows your capacity, so why does he have to test you? Then, why the misery? It is <I>thithiksha</I>, or forbearance, in you. And forbearance could be increased by prayerful surrender or vigorous challenge for patience! (Laughter)</P>

<P>&nbsp;Picnic to Neelkant hills and holy Haridwar was a grand finale to the Rishikesh course, followed by a wild Satsang in New Delhi. It was so charged! Guruji is back in the Ashram for a quiet three days before his Australian tour.</P>
<P>&nbsp;From U.K.: Guruji had given a rose to a lady on February 13 and they called to say that the flower was still amazingly fresh and fragrant after six weeks! This miracle inspired an otherwise unwilling lady to do the course.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Important exercise: Find out what it is that has been with you forever. Belma says that she asked herself this question 20 years ago and she knows all the answers. And that there is only one answer . . . . (Laughter)</P>

<P>When someone is drowning in the ocean of attachments, surrender is the life jacket they can put on and wait for the rescue team.

<P>&nbsp;Like that, the word "disillusionment." It is good that you are disillusioned. You have come to reality. Like <I>purana.</I> It means "that which is new in the town, the most modern." But it is used in the sense of being old. In the course of time, meanings of words change. The word "enthused" comes from the Greek which means "God is with us." Then it came to mean crazy, and now it's changed again.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Don't be stuck with the words. Your worries are words. Your ideas are words. Wisdom is beyond words. It is the very Being. It is the essence of all words. See and relate beyond words. Then there is no lie in your life.</P>
<P>&nbsp;If you manipulate words, it is a lie. If you play on words, it is a joke. If you rely on words, it is ignorance. If you transcend words, it is wisdom.</P>

<P>&nbsp;The skies opened and grace poured down in buckets at the Ashram this week. It was a confluence of eight prominent saints of India who in a private meeting honored Guruji in one of their ashrams. Each of these saints gives lectures or Darshan to hundreds of thousands of devotees and they all run their own schools, hospitals and ashrams. Four of them who were just introduced to Guruji followed us for a brief tour of our Ashram.</P>
<P>&nbsp;When they were all at Sumeru Mantap, lightening and thunder surrounded us and everyone was drenched and then they ran to Guruji's kutir. Immediately these very popular and formal Sanyasis began to shed their orange garments. But what to give them to wear? Guruji gave them all white dhotis. Soon they were all wearing our Guruji's white dhotis and being fed by his hand looking more and more like a group of joyful children happy to be home again. Somehow in their "new clothes" they began to relax and smile and laugh and soon the grace of our Guru had them radiating from deep inside. </P>
<P>&nbsp;All of us were shocked to see how the formal heads of institutions were transformed and by the time they were leaving, they humbly asked for Guruji's blessings and invited him to their ashrams and to lead them in meditation. They said, "Mother Nature gave us all a bath before entering your temple, Guruji." We stood and watched this event with awe and laughter.</P>
<P>&nbsp;The first advanced course has started at the Ashram.</P>

<P>&nbsp;Guruji took over fifty people to see the night safari in Singapore which is the only night safari in the world. The guide kept saying that our group was unusually lucky because every single animal in the forest came near the tram "to give or take Darshan!" The local people who have been to this place several times were so surprised.</P>

    <P>Illusion is error of perception and knowing illusion as illusion is Knowledge. Our experience of the world is based on perception. Since every perception is erroneous, the world is an illusion. Experiences are all of perception. The experiencer is the only reality. Look for the seer, the experiencer, in between experiences. Every experience leaves a hangover and clouds the intellect. Wake up this moment. Shake your head of all past experiences and look at the pure Being that I am and that you are.</P>
    <P>Question: How do you distinguish the experience and the experiencer?</P>
    <P>Answer: Are you really all here? Are you listening? Now close your eyes and see who is listening, who is questioning, who is sitting, and who wants what? Who is confused? You may not get any answer but that is fine. Never mind.</P> 		</font>

    <P>&nbsp;Chinese movie maker tried his level best to sign up Guruji for his latest block buster. Guruji said, "I don't know acting," and the movie maker said, "Just be natural, accept the situation as it is, take responsibility, be 100%." The movie is about a wise man who brought Buddhism to China. The movie maker said that through this mega performance, the Art of Living would reach the whole of China. Guruji winked at his devotees and said, "Should I change my profession?"</P>
    <P>&nbsp;The first advanced course ended and the second has begun. The Ashram is bustling with people. Every inch of space is occupied -- three times the holding capacity of the Ashram and yet no complaints. No chaos! So smooth! Only laughter and new songs have filled Sumeru Mantap.</P>

<P>&nbsp;The Ashram was specially lit up to match the smiles of about a thousand devotees from all over. Tents were pitched for people. Thanks to the excellent organizing and the volunteers who made everyone feel very special and taken care of. Belma says it was not chaos as expected!</P>

<P>&nbsp;The Knowledge acquired by a human being cannot be measured or judged by external behavior. Someone may behave as though they have absorbed all the Knowledge but internally they have not. The reverse is also true. Someone who seems to have not changed at all may have absorbed a lot.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Ordinary people would just look at the behavior, but the intelligent looks beyond and is amazed by the play of the consciousness (<I>Brahman</I>).</P>

        <P>Today marks the one year anniversary of these Knowledge Sheets. The year which started in Big Sur and is ending in St. Louis, began in KNOWLEDGE and is concluding in SEVA. Knowledge Sheets now go to more than 300 Satsang groups touching 7000 people every week around the world!</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>SEVA IS SAVIOR</B></P>
      
      <P>&nbsp;The way to expand from individual to universal consciousness is to share others's sorrow and joy. As you grow, your consciousness should also grow. When you expand in Knowledge with time, then depression is not possible. Your inner most source is joy.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;The way to overcome personal misery is to share universal misery! The way to expand personal joy is to share universal joy. Instead of thinking "what about me?" "what can I gain from this world?" think "what can I do for the world?" When everyone comes from the point of contributing to society, you have a Divine society. We have to educate and culture our individual consciousness in order to expand in time with the Knowledge . . . from "what about me?" to "what can I contribute?"</P>
      <P>&nbsp;If you are not having good experiences in meditation, then do more seva -- you will gain merit and your meditation will be deeper. When you bring some relief or freedom to someone through seva, good vibrations and blessings come to you. Seva brings merit; merit allows you to go deep in meditation; meditation brings back your smile.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>&nbsp;<B>Answer to last week's riddle:</B> </P>
      <P>&nbsp;That something which is so precious to you is your smile -- your joy. You lose it in the world and find it in the self, in Satsang. If you can't find it here, at the Ashram, forget about it. Your can't find it anywhere.</P>

    <P>&nbsp;The wise will not stay on the surface but will probe into the depth. Things are not blurred; your vision is blurred. Infinite actions prevail in the wholeness of consciousness. And yet the consciousness remains perfect, untouched. As Satsangees, realize this now and be at Home.</P>

    <P>&nbsp;<B>NEWS FLASH from BBC (Beautiful British Columbia)</B>:</P>
    <P>&nbsp;In St. Louis a man diagnosed with a malignancy in his shoulder came to receive Guruji's blessings. The next day he came to Satsang and to the astonishment of the doctors, the man had been healed even though the MRI had shown a tear and a growth on the shoulder cuff. As the man told his story and presented a dozen red roses to Guruji, tears of gratitude rolled down everyone's cheeks. There were many reported healing experiences in St. Louis and Chicago.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;The Chicago organizers said, "Here comes the Art of Living circus to town." (Laughter) There was an air of celebration as the devotees from the U.S. Midwest gathered with non-stop giggling and laughter. People were driving in circles, forgetting traffic rules, not sleeping, and laughing as Guruji (our sit-down comedian) amazed everyone.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;We rushed on to Portland. Dean says we have become Rushins instead of American, Indians, and Canadians. At The Old Church, there was not even standing space. The sight of Guruji put smiles on every face.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;In Vancouver, the Aboriginal People warmly hosted Guruji at the University of British Columbia. The sky, the sea, the snow-capped mountains, the tall trees and the waterfalls all beckoned for the Knowledge.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Sudarshana left the room for five minutes and returned asking, "What did I miss?" Marcy said, "Enlightenment!" (Laughter)</P>

      <P>Though you have heard "don't judge," judgement comes unavoidably in day-to-day life. By the actions and behaviors of people, you either approve or disapprove. But always remember that everything is changing, and do not hold onto the judgement. Otherwise your judgement gets solidified like a rock. It brings misery for you and for others.</P>
<P>If judgements are lighter like air, like a breeze, they bring in fragrance, then move away. They could bring a foul smell, then move away. They should not stay there forever.</P>
<P>Judgements are so subtle that you are not even aware of their existence. Judging or labeling someone as judgmental is also a judgement. Only in the state of Being when you are full of love and compassion can you ever be free from all judgements.</P>
<P>Yet the world cannot move without judgements. Until you judge something as good or bad, you cannot do any actions. If you see rotten apples in the market, you say, "No good." Good ones you buy. If someone lies to you ten times, you think next time it also could be a lie. A judgment happens automatically.</P>
<P>See the possibility that people and things can change at any time and don't hold onto the judgements.</P>
<P>You need to judge your company. Your company can pull you up or pull you down. The company that drags you towards doubt, dejection, blame, complaints, anger, delusion, and desires is bad company. The company that pulls you up towards joy, enthusiasm, service, love, trust, and Knowledge is good company.</P>
<P>When someone complains, first you listen, then you nod, then you sympathize, then you complain.</P>
<P>Robert says, "Join the party." Denise says, "I confess, you are absolutely right." (Laughter)</P>

    <P>&nbsp;We emerged from silence to celebrate at the lake the fifth anniversary of the Ashram. It was like a fairytale with the full moon rising above the trees, the sounds of Susannah's and Phillip's flutes, fireworks, and bonfires. The Guru took us spinning in circles on a raft and to our surprise brought us back to the same shore. In the confusion, we forgot to serve the anniversary cake.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;After the Montreal talk, Denise drove off with Guruji in the car with all the doors open. Ramola ran from behind and jumped in. In the fever to get into the Guru's car, somebody left luggage behind, another left a purse, another left their shoes, and they all left their minds.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Guruji and Phillip have just left for Toronto and then are to go to Colorado.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;On the 14th of July an Interfaith Prayer and Meditation Conference will be sponsored by the Art of Living in Washington DC. Ten Swamis from India have been invited. </P>
    <P>&nbsp;Thomas called Punditji to tell him that a forest fire raging at Lake Tahoe which burned many million dollar houses, came up to his property, burned his tool shed, but stopped at his front door. Neither his home -- where many Satsangs had been held -- nor his garden were damaged.</P>

      <P>Setting up a time-bound goal gives direction to the life force. Imagination is essential for this. Most people have a small imagination and are stuck with that, and that causes frustration. But if you are a devotee, you say "Let Thy Will be done" and then you will step lightly to the goal. You will take it easy. We have to make a distinction. Some people say "Let God do everything and surrender" and others say "I have to be responsible."</P>
      <P>Surrender is saying "Let Thy Will be done" and "Thy Will" for you is to take responsibility for the whole world.</P>
      <P>It appears to be opposing and conflicting in nature -- in fact they are two sides of the same coin. The more you surrender, the more responsive you become. One who is irresponsible cannot surrender either. Why is someone irresponsible? They are lazy or fearful or both. If you are lazy or fearful, you cannot be in love.</P>
      <P>Total responsibility is total surrender. It's a little hard to chew, but this is the truth. People usually say either I take responsibility or surrender, but I tell you they go hand in hand. Suppose you are surrendered to the Knowledge. That means you are committed to sharing it with others. You take responsibility to see that it flourishes.</P>
      <P>Question: The confusion comes with the doership?</P>
      <P>Answer: When you are taking responsibility and you find blocks, remember "surrender." That gives you strength to move ahead. It releases you from the weight of the doership. Responsibility is the dynamic expression of life in the present moment. When you are shaken, remember the basis of responsibility as surrender.</P>
      <P>Taking responsibility or surrendering without doership is the skill of the wise. Total irresponsibility is impossible for you. Limited responsibility makes you weak. A little water in the sun will evaporate but the ocean never dries up. Limited responsibility tires you out. Unlimited responsibility empowers you and brings you joy.</P> 		</font>

      <P>&nbsp;The fireworks arrived July 4th with Guruji at Colorado's largest advanced and basic courses ever. The hall was dressed with red, white, and blue balloons and ribbons in celebration of Independence (of the United States and our spirits). As we watched the explosions spread across the horizon, Guruji said, "That looks just like your minds." Guruji took a hike in the mountains and then met an enthusiastic crowd in Colorado Springs before flying on to California. There was a Satsang in Anu and N.J.'s home in Apple Valley for over 150 devotees before the Art of Living entourage moved on to northern California. There have been non-stop talks and Satsangs celebrating Guruji's summer tour to the U.S.</P>

        <B><P>NEWS from Washington, DC</B>: </P>
        <P>The Interfaith Prayer and Meditation Conference was wonderful and dramatic. Suzannah opened the Conference with her beautiful Hallelujah Bhajan and was joined by everyone. Children sang traditional devotional songs, and delegates from many faiths lit candles, offered deeply felt prayers, sang sweet hymns and led us in meditation. Represented were the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Bahai's, Buddhism, Church of Christ, Islam, Sufism, the Unity Church, Free Masonry, Hinduism, Presbyterian and Sikh, among others. An African holy man swathed in flowing white robes bowed before each delegate and the audience. </P>
        <P>The nine Swamis from India, in their golden robes, dramatically entered the auditorium during the program and gave their blessings to Guruji. Guruji, sitting in the center of them all, provided the closing meditation. John was master of ceremonies and did a wonderful job staying centered amidst the chaos of program changes that nobody even noticed!</P>
        <P>The Satsang that evening in the local Hindu Temple was sweet and full of lively spiritual energy. Guruji in white, sitting on the stage surrounded by the golden robed Swamis was a beautiful sight!</P>

    <P>Only one who is 100 percent in doing can recognize the happening.</P>
    <P>The healthiest way to apply this knowledge is to see the whole past as happening and the present as doing. If you see the past as doing, then ego and regret come along. And when you see the present as happening, then laziness and unawareness set in. If you apply the doing for the future, it brings tension and worry. If you apply the happening for the future, it might bring some confidence and also lethargy.</P>
    <P>Let the happening be for the past. Let the doing be for the present. And the future is a mix of both.</P>
    <P>The wise will see the doing in happening and the happening in doing simultaneously. Are you confused now? (Laughter)</P>
    <P>One who does a lot of work will never say he did a lot. When someone says he did a lot of work, that means he can do more. He has not done enough. </P>
    <P>Work does not tire you as much as the doership does. All the talents you have are for others. If you have good voice, it is for others. If you are a good cook, it is for others. If you write a good book, it is for others. What do you do? You donÒ´ sit and read your own book! If you are a good carpenter, it is for others. So all of your talents are useful for others. If you are a good surgeon, it is for others. You cannot do your own surgery. This is interesting. If you are school teacher, it is for others. You cannot teach your own children; they donÒ´ listen to you anyway. So all your work and talents are for others.</P>

      <P>&nbsp;Guruji: How many of you are grateful here? (<I>Everybody raises their hand</I>.) If you are grateful, you don't belong to Me! (<I>Everyone is shocked</I>.) You are not part of the Master. When someone gives you something, you are grateful. That means you feel separate. You are not grateful to yourself.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;Gratefulness is inevitable. When you go beyond gratefulness, then union happens. No "I," no "you" remains. You are part of the Master. You are just One Being with a thousand heads and a thousand arms, but with one heart. You have got to be grateful on the path, but you have to transcend gratefulness. Better stop being grateful. (<I>Laughter.</I>) </P>
      <P>&nbsp;When you are grateful then <I>you</I> are the center, <I>you</I> are more important. When you are grateful to God for having received something beautiful, for example, eyesight, who is important? You or God? You! So your gratitude indicates ego.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;Richard: But you are not grateful?</P>
      <P>Guruji: I am simply great and I am full! (<I>Laughter</I>) Don't be grateful; just be great -- and be full! (<I>Laughter</I>)</P>
      <P>&nbsp;This Knowledge is very dangerous! When you are part of the Master, you have every right to be happy. You have every right to Knowledge, happiness, and the whole universe!</P>
      <P>Angelika: Small children donÒ´ feel grateful as long as they feel one. They take everything for granted. </P>
      <P>Meike: You are not grateful to your own hand which feeds you.</P>
      <P>Ananda: On one of the courses you said in the thanking process, "Now, thank yourself for being here!" So you can thank yourself.</P>
      <P>Guruji: if you wish, you can! This is true celebration: thanking yourself!</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * *</P>
      <P>&nbsp;Balder: Could you say something about the relationship to friends and the relationship to the Master?</P>

        </B><P>Guruji arrived at the Washington airport and drove to three Satsangs and had dinner, then dinner, then dinner. Next day Bhanu shopped from 10 am to 5 pm.</P>
        <P>Bhanu says, "Don't write that!"</P>
        <P>Dr. Ganesh Prabhu, one of the leading cardiovascular surgeons, formerly of Johns Hopkins Hospital, asked if he could sit and meditate alone with Guruji without anyone else around. The deal was struck. Dr. Prabhu used a holter monitor on Guruji to measure the heart function while he was meditating. Afterwards Guruji departed for Los Angeles.</P>
        <P>Dr. Prabhu called Guruji at about 8:00 that evening with the information that the heart rate recorded went from 10 per minute to 2 and stopped completely twice. He was even more excited and amazed that the machine kept recording a heartbeat for nearly 10 hours after being disconnected from Guruji. He asked, "What happened? What happened?" His joy knew no limits. Never before in his career had he seen anything like this. He said he would frame the read-out.</P>
        <P>Guruji arrived in Los Angeles for the long-awaited Summer Celebration. Sixty people were on seva teams with Ann McFadden at the helm. Nine swamis who were our guests began an intensive sightseeing campaign, dragging Wally and John through Disneyland, Universal Studios, and Sea World starting at 8:00 in the morning. Often you could hear the swamis saying, "Where is Honey?" (Wally's motor home.)</P>
        <P>There was a grand Satsang in San Diego with the Swamis. Then as Guruji arrived in L.A. there was a memorable Prayer Conference evening at the famous Agape Center. Everyone spoke about unity. Then Guruji stood up and shocked the audience by saying, "Unity is impossible." He continued by explaining that in order for there to be unity, there has to be two. Yet there is only One in the whole universe.</P>
        <P>Next day Guruji gave a beautiful talk at the Unity Church in Tustin. "All of your life becomes a meditation," he said. "Whether you look at the trees or the flowers or talk with people, you are in meditation." He encouraged people to stay with their daily meditation practice. After the talk we all looked up and saw a big puffy heart in the clear blue sky. That evening there was an electrifying Satsang with many birthdays at the Doubletree Hotel with 350 course participants.</P>

          <P>Suppose you go to God, get a boon, and walk away. When your intention is to get a boon, then you are in a hurry. Another person who knows he owns God is not in a hurry for anything. Infinite patience comes up in him.</P>
          <P>When you know you own God, you are not in a hurry to get something out of God. Your hurry to get something throws you off balance and makes you small. Have "eternal wait," infinite patience. When you have infinite patience, you will realize God belongs to you. Either through awareness or through practice you reach the same spot.</P>
          <P>Question: What do you mean by "owning God?"</P>
          <P>Answer: The Divinity belongs to you. It's not like shopping at the supermarket in a hurry and rushing back home. When you see the whole store is at home, you are not in a hurry to shop. You are at ease.</P>
          <P>Question: To develop patience do we just observe the impatience?</P>
          <P>Answer: Just observe the thoughts and feelings and don't regret about it.</P>
          <P>When you know you are part of the divine plan, you stop demanding. Then you know everything is being done for you. You are taken care of. Usually we do it the other way: we hurry the mind and are slow in our action. Impatience means hurry in the mind; lethargy means slowness in action. Patience in the mind and dynamism in action is the right formula.</P> 		</font>

A public Satsang was given for the first time in Princeton, New Jersey and the talk in New York was greatly admired by everyone. Guruji gave four television programs in this tour, including The Discovery Channel and Korean TV.

        <P>After the Satsang a small group of about 150 people met with Guruji and were playing with the words and arguing with him and telling him how mean he is that he doesn't spend much time with them and yet has stolen their hearts. Guruji kept winning by twisting their arguments and people laughed like anything.</P>
        <P>Guruji: Whether you win or lose an argument with me you are still laughing. Why?</P>
        <P>Because there is total sense of belongingness. When there is a total sense of belongingness, real play happens. Winning or losing is irrelevant.</P>
        <P>Normally what happens to you when you lose an argument? You are sad and upset, hurt and angry. But when you lose or win an argument with me you are still happy. How come?</P>
        <P>1. There is a sense of belongingness.</P>
        <P>2. Your love stands out and everything else becomes secondary. Like perfection, comfort,</P>
        <P>desires, etc. Isn't it?</P>
        <P>3. Your ability to put the "Being" before the happening.</P>
        <P>4. And your confidence in the ultimate good.</P>
        <P>CanÒ´ you have this same attitude with everyone?</P>
        <P>Today is Krishna's birthday. Krishna's life was full of conflicts and yet he kept smiling and dancing. May you dance through the conflicts and contribute to this planet.</P> 		</font>

        </B><P>Bombay was in a hot mood for a wild Satsang but in cool weather! Then on to Surat which was hectic. The spectacular decorations and the vibrant Satsangs thrilled the thousands who gathered to get a glimpse of Guruji. The next morning in Baroda, Guruji addressed a rapt audience of 700 senior executives. In the evening Satsang the assembly hall of the palace of Baroda was an apt royal setting. Thanks to Kartik for setting up closed circuit TVs -- the overflowing crowd did not feel lost.</P>
        <P>Even a curious ant could not walk into the jam-packed Satsang in Ahmedabad as thousands basked in devotion and Knowledge, and Guruji stood up majestically to address them -- what a space!</P>
        <P>Today is Krishna's birthday and all planes are leading to Bangalore.</P>

        <P><B>NEWS FLASH</B></P>
        </B><P>After a busy course schedule in the Ashram, Bangalore, Guruji addressed a large group of professionals and industrialists in Rajkot followed by an enthusiastic Satsang of more than 3000 devotees. Decorations and the organization and spirit of the enthusiastic crowd set an example. Guruji left for an advanced course of nearly 700 participants in Koijavaran, Baroda. </P>
        <P>P.S. Although the Knowledge Sheet was prepared on time last week there was a delay in sending it and this brought up an interesting fax from Ottawa, Canada which is enclosed here as a supplement:</P>
        <P>Thank you for this week's very eloquent Knowledge Fax. We continue to ponder its meaning. In deciphering its meaning we rely on clues that you have given previously. You have said, "I am always talking to you. You only have to look for a sign."</P>
        <P>We recognize that many people will say, "There was no Knowledge Fax this week." Of course, they are mistaken. Some people will say, "The Guru finally missed a deadline. Of course, He is just human, like everyone else. He probably ran out of things to say, got tired. Maybe there was no computer nearby. Maybe he called in sick." Some people, asleep, may not have noticed.</P>
        <P>However, knowing that the Guru is communicating even when He says nothing at all, we seek the deeper meaning of the week's Knowledge Sheet or Nonsheet. Let us simply say, We seek the deeper meaning of this week's Sandesh. </P>
        <P>Option 1: It is all changing</P>
        <P>Everything is changing. Nothing stays for all time. "Life is teaching us, at every moment, the art of letting go." Even Knowledge Faxes will not be there for ever. Letting Go. Ultimately we must let go of even the Knowledge as object, as something "out there."</P>
        <P>Option 2. I am the Knowledge </P>
        <P>Living the knowledge, becoming the knowledge. That is what we must aspire to. The Knowledge Fax is not just a piece of paper, a bit of amusement each week, which titillates the intellect and which we promptly forget, and go about our meaningless and mundane lives. </P>
        <P>Sub-Option 2.1. "Enough Knowledge has been given. Digest that." </P>
        <P>We must assimilate the Knowledge that has already been given, make it a part of us. There is a rhythm in all things. The cycle of the year goes around again. The cycle of the Knowledge as well. Let us remember and re-learn the knowledge given in the previous cycle. </P>
        <P>Option 3. Grace and Gratitude </P>
        <P>"To those who have, more will be given. To those who have not, even what little they have will be taken away from them. " </P>
        <P>How much gratitude have we had for the Knowledge that has been given each week? How much have we valued the Knowledge Faxes? How much awareness, how much attention have we put on them? Have they become just another routine, something else to take for granted? Wherever we put our attention, that will increase. Have we not put enough attention on the Knowledge Sheets each week?</P>
        <P>Option 4. Silence </P>
        <P>Truth is beyond words. Therefore whatever we speak is false. Only in silence can we know the Truth. Only in silence can we be the Truth. </P>
        <P>Meditate. Be silent. Know thy Self. </P>
        <P>Option 5. The Unbaked Pot </P>
        <P>When you pour water into an unbaked pot, the water is wasted, and so is the pot. Before you put water into a pot, you should bake the pot. The Guru is now baking all the pots. When they are baked, then he will be able to fill them with the water of Knowledge. But for now, why waste all that good water? </P>
        <P>Objection: But how can the pots be baked without the Fire of Knowledge? </P>
        <P>This is a very good point. I suppose there are other fires. The fire of criticism and humiliation; the fire of hunger; the fire of lust; the fire of longing; the physical fire of heat. You should ask the Guru to speak on the five fires. </P>
        <P>Option 6. The Answer to Last Week's Non-riddle </P>
        <P>Look for the meaning hidden in all the events. And a non-event is also an event. There was a "sandesh" contained within the box of Sandesh sweets given to the Guru last week. Similarly, what is the meaning hidden in this week's non-fax?</P>
        <P>"Let those who have ears hear." Hearing the silence. This is what we must do. </P>
        <P>Option 7. Just Testing </P>
        <P>The Guru is testing our level of dismay at not receiving a fax this week. It seems that the level of dismay was appropriately high, as it now appears a fax has indeed been sent, albeit belatedly. (I just called Bill Hayden. Poor Bill. Apparently a good proportion of the people on the continent also called him.) </P>
        <P>So what to read into this? Possibility: The Guru is soft-hearted, he cannot bear our disappointment. Or: The Guru is disappointed. We did not receive the silent fax he sent; so he was obliged to send a fax containing words. Or: The Guru is pleased. Our collective dismay at not receiving a fax this week proved to him that we do deeply value the Knowledge given each week and we are extremely grateful or ? ? ?</P>
       
        <P>P.P.S. The above Knowledge Fax Supplement was sent by Susannah and the Ottawa Satsang group on 21st September regarding Knowledge Fax #67. </P>

    <P>Look at the people who have no discipline; they are miserable. Freedom without discipline is absolute misery. Discipline without freedom is suffocating.</P>
    <P>Orderliness is monotonous and chaos is stressful.</P>
    <P>We have to make the discipline free and the freedom disciplined.</P>

    </B><P>The big advanced course at the ashram of Kripalu Maharaj (the founder of Kripalu Yoga) at Kayavaran in India brought celebration to the ashram. It was all so well organized that there were no complaints and no one felt lost in the big group. There was one teacher taking care of every 25 people. People were sharing so many miraculous stories.</P>
    <P>The outdoor Satsangs in the moon light and Christmas lights simply transformed the place into Brindavan. On the last evening, Guruji appeared in pink silks and was adorned with a crown of beautiful flowers and a peacock feather. Guruji received 400 garlands from devotees. Each garland that hung around Guruji's neck, when being removed took a few hairs with it.</P>
    <P>This was a course that started in bliss and ended in chaos. Even though people thought there was no chaos, an impatient aeroplane left Guruji behind after the course, whereas the next plane in the next city and after a three-hour drive, graciously took Him and His group as the last passengers. The race did not end until He boarded His international connecting flight -- again as the last passenger . . . </P>

As many people met Guruji for the first time, it was like a dream come true for them. Virtually everybody had a miraculous experience to tell. One family had spent 7 months salary to come to meet Guruji. Another family sold their house to meet Gurudev. Over 1000 people filled the stadium and the auditorium looked splendid and all the teachers had worked hard to make the stadium look splendid and magnificent. People from Lithuania, St. Petersburg, Moscow, Minsk, and many other towns had gathered in a very festive mood. Russian television covered Guruji's arrival in Mumbai. There was a grand reception for Guruji. When he sat on his seat, all the flowers over him seemed to reach out for his Darshan. It seemed as if there was a waterfall of flowers and Guruji was smiling in the center. In the evening, Guruji was presented with two flowers, with which he played around for hours and kept posing for photographs. The conversation was diverted to the lotus flowers.</P>

    <P>Q: Many ask for blessings but only a few will receive it.  Why?</P>

    <P>A: The giver is anyway giving but the taker is not there - the sincerity is missing.  One who gives blessings gives it freely but the one who receives it has to be sincere.  Sincerity is the qualification to receive blessings.  And everyone is free to be sincere at any point of time or space.</P>
    
    <P>Q: Why do people choose to be sincere only sometimes?</P>
    
    <P>A: Because of the illusion that they are going to miss some mundane pleasure.  Hankering after pleasure makes them insincere.  When you are sincere you simply enjoy pleasure.</P>
    
    <P>Poor people fight for food.  Rich people share their food.  Richer are those people who share power.  Richer still are those who share fame.  Richest are those who share themselves.  Richness of a person is indicated by his ability to share and not by what he hoards.  Godliness is enjoying sharing fame.</P>

    <P>The silence became alive with Vedic chantings.  The saffron clad Swamis on either side of Guru Dev added luster to the gathering.  The whole Ashram was so vibrant with Divine energy that the renowned pundits who had performed so many Yagyas felt the difference.  As the Pundits became busier, the devotees became serene and still.  The silence was thick and profound and the celebration was loud and colorful.  And with each passing day Guru Dev grew younger and more radiant.  Those who walked near Guru Dev's Kutir would experience different fragrances which kept changing every few minutes!</P>

      <P>In the Ashram some people wanted white bread to be served at breakfast.  Some were opposed to this and it caused a big conflict (laughter) because they couldn't find any other reason to be in conflict.  Just one phone call from Guruji set everyone in astonishment.</P>
      
      <P>The diplomatic reception, the piles and piles of flower and the smiling crowd at the airport was a great part of the Taipei event.  Guruji addressed a group of medical professionals in the afternoon and an interfaith conference attended by many religious leaders in the evening.  An advanced course followed on the hilltop retreat center.  The experiences of the people were great.  One lady in her mid-thirties had been in a wheelchair and could not walk for several years.  She started walking after she met Guruji on the previous advanced course.  On the last day of the course, Sharmila and Guruji cooked for 20 volunteers who stayed back to clean up, and you know what?  When dinner was served, 60 people showed up!  All were fed with the food left over.</P>
      
      <P>Amid tears and laughter the party moved</P>
      <P> on to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  The honorable Minister for Works was present at the official launching of the Malaysian Art of Living Society.  Several prominent leaders came to take blessings from Guruji.  One of them asked, &quot;What is the limit of want?&quot;  Guruji said, &quot;Unhappiness.&quot;  It was a colorful evening with Satsang and dinner.  The lights of the local TV stations were so powerful that the circuit breakers switched off twice!</P>

    <P>3. It projects the up-bringing of the person</P>
    <P>4. It indicates a behavioral pattern</P>
    <P>5. It shows lack of knowledge</P>
    <P>6. It shows lack of observation of one's own mind and its sensations</P>
    <P>7. It shows you behavior to avoid</P>
    <P>8. It is an opportunity for you to welcome and absorb the rudeness</P>
    <P>9. It strengthens your mind</P>

    <P>Guruji came from Delhi for an overnight stay at the Ashram and left the next morning to Kerala.  Organizers in Delhi as well as in Cochin (Trivandrum and Trichur) had experienced very clearly the non-doership of the big event.  Everything fell in its space at the right moment as always.  Enthusiastic devotees in Cochin renovated their homes.  After Cochin, Guruji rushed to the colorful Trichur (In Trichur as usual there was chaos and asana-snatch).  Excellent team work and elaborate arrangements were appreciated by thousands who came to the Satsang.  The Kerala-style decorated elephants with umbrellas and the ballkas dressed in traditional attire carrying lights and flowers were a spectacular welcome.  Many people shared their amazing healing experiences.  Then the whole troop moved to Trivandrum, the town of infinity.  The king of Kerala received Guruji at the Senate Hall with a packed audience of 4000 people.  Colorful umbrellas, elephants, the traditional horns and drums and the Vedic chanting filled the air.  People were enraptured for a three and a half hour program.  The next morning newspapers were filled with the news of the Art of Living Satsang.</P>

He did not even take any medicine.</P>
  
  <P>People came to the Advanced Course for silence and were blasted by loud raucous music from the local village.  People came all the way from Germany for the sunny weather for which Bangalore is known at this time of the year.  They got dreary clouds, chilling wind, and rain.  In addition, there were frequent power cuts which ensured that people took cold water baths in the morning.  GurujiÒ³ voice went hoarse and He needed a tap on His own throat!</P>

    <P>Matter has two aspects: name and form.  </P>

    <P>Answer: So that we can grow to perfection.  Life is a movement from imperfection to perfection.  A seed contains the tree but the seed has to cease to be a seed to become a tree.  The seed is not perfect.  The sapling is not perfect.  It has to cease to be a sapling to become a tree.  So in life you can either see imperfection at every step, or you can see a movement from one perfection to another perfection.</P>

  <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>SURRENDER AND SELF-RELIANCE</B></P>
  
  <P>Self-reliance needs enormous courage.</P>

<P>Surrender needs less courage.</P>

<P>A person who cannot surrender cannot be self-reliant either.</P>

<P>If you don't have enough courage to surrender, then it is impossible  for you to be self-reliant.  You simply fool yourself.   People who are afraid to surrender fool themselves.   Because even a little fear is detrimental to self-reliance.</P>

<P>If you don't have a hundred dollars, you cannot have a thousand dollars.</P>

<P>Self-reliance contains surrender.   Fifty dollars contains ten dollars.</P>

<P>Question:    Why does self-reliance need so much courage?</P>

<P>When you want to depend on yourself for everything, there is nobody else, then it needs a lot of courage.</P>

<P>Often people think that surrender is a way to escape from  responsibility and they end up blaming the Divine for all their problems.   In fact, the  true surrender is taking total responsibility for everything.</P>

<P>Susannah:    How can we do that?</P>

<P>You take responsibility and you pray for help.</P>

<P>Surrender eventually leads you to self-reliance.   Because there is nothing other than the Big Self.</P> 		</font>

</B>
<P>A Madras satsang of 3500 people served as a farewell party for Guruji  on the eve of his departure from India.   It was held in a gigantic marble hall; and a choir of seventy school girls serenaded Guruji with well-rehearsed  and enthusiastic bhajans.   An entourage of forty-five devotees traveled from Bangalore to Madras for the occasion.</P>

<P>India's warm December weather, bougainvillea and coconut palms have now been replaced by Switzerland's mist-shrouded Alpine peaks, snow-covered palms, and the swans on Lake Lucerne.</P>

<P>Today is Christmas, and appropriately all the course participants have gone into silence this morning to celebrate in a deep and authentic way.</P>

<P>Guruji's message for Christmas:<B>    BE A FOUNTAIN OF LOVE</P></B></FONT>

      <P>Let the time celebrate your presence.  You keep smiling as ever.  Usually people make a wish for the New Year.  This year, make no wish.  Let the New Year celebrate you.  If it wants to bring you nicer things, let it.  It's up to it.</P>

    <P>Different organs of our body are governed by different devas. The solar plexus is connected with the sun, that's why it is called "solar" plexus. When the first rays of the sun fall on the solar plexus, it is very good for your body. Doing <I>Surya Namaskar</I> ("sun salutation") yoga asana in the early morning is very good. The solar plexus has a profound impact on the central nervous system, optic nerves, stomach, and what we usually call "gut feeling." It is the second brain in your body. Usually the solar plexus is slightly bigger than an almond. Studies have shown that with the practice of yoga, meditation, and Sudarshan Kriya, the solar plexus can become as a large as the size of the palm. Then it performs better. It balances the body functions. When the solar plexus expands, the intuitive mind works better. The mind becomes clear and focussed. When the solar plexus contracts, one feels horrible, sad, depressed, and all the negative feelings come.</P>
    <P>Krishna was called Padmanabha, meaning "whose navel is the size of a lotus flower." If you become Padmanabha, you become absolutely creative. Brahma, the Creator, is born out of a blossomed solar plexus.</P>
    <P>These days, the solar plexus remains small, but the tummy keeps getting bigger.</P>

  <P>In <I>Bhakti</I> there are four letters.  It's made up of &quot;bha&quot;, &quot;ka&quot;, &quot;ta&quot;, and &quot;i&quot; (ee).  &quot;Bha&quot; stands for fulfillment and nourishment.  &quot;Ka&quot; stands for knowing - a means of knowing.  &quot;Ta&quot; stands for redeeming, for saving, for salvation.  &quot;I&quot; (ee) stands for <I>shakti</I>.</P>

<P>So in <I>Bhakti</I> four things are there: fulfillment and nourishment; means of knowing; &quot;<I>tarana</I>&quot; or salvation; and energy.  <I>Bhakti</I> saves you.  <I>Bhakti</I> nourishes you.  <I>Bhakti</I> is the means of knowing, the right knowledge.  When <I>Bhakti</I> is there the doubts don't come.  It gives the most energy.  So <I>Bhakti</I> contains as the seed all the four qualities.</P>

<P>All the emotional upheavals one undergoes is because one doesn't know <I>Bhakti</I>.  When all intense feelings flow in one direction that is <I>Bhakti</I>, it becomes <I>Bhakti</I>.  What is the difference between a canal and a flooded field?  In a flood what happens is the water does not have a bank to flow in.  When the water flows within banks you call it &quot;river&quot;.  When water is scattered all over, it's all flooded.  So when the emotions get flooded everywhere, mind is in a mess.  If it is intensely flowing in a direction, then that is <I>Bhakti</I>.  And that is most powerful.</P>

<P>A sign of Intelligence is Surrender or <I>Bhakti</I>.</P> 		</font>

Then he completed the European Teacher's Refresher week, managing to meet with every group from every country represented before taking off for Trinidad.  There he was received at the airport by the Minister of Social Development, and met the following day with first the President of Trinidad and then the Prime Minister.  Guruji spoke to over-flowing crowds each evening.</P>

<P>Janael McQueen said that a Joytish (astrologer) had said many devotees would be enlightened in the next ten years.  Michael Fischman said, &quot;Oh, when it happens to you, give me a call!&quot;</P>

The Satsang group met in the airport VIP lounge on the way back during a stop over in St. Lucia (a Caribbean island). There was a diplomatic reception in Curacao (another island near Venezuela) and a big Satsang. For the first public talk there was a full house. On to Panama, where Martine and Dr. Chu hosted a large Satsang and then Shirley was the copilot of the small plane that took the group to the Panama Canal. Manu, from Hong Kong, is organizing courses all over Central and South America. Marjorie and her team organized a packed house for a great talk in Costa Rica. This trip gave a huge boost to the spreading of the knowledge throughout the Caribbean and Central America.</P>
    <B><P>Short story</B>: Guruji was walking along the beach with some devotees and there was a huge desalination plant (changes salt water to fresh water) costing millions of dollars. Nearby was a coconut tree. Guruji looked and pointed out that the tree is a natural desalination plant. It takes the salt water from the earth and makes the fresh water inside the coconut. The knowledge is like the tree -- it takes us from salty mud to the pure bliss.</P>

Events, small things make strong impressions on it. And you cannot find a better place than the Divine to keep your heart safe and your mind sane. When you keep your heart in the Divine, the moving time, the passing events, will not be able to touch it, will not create a scar. A precious stone needs a setting around it, gold or silver, to hold it and to wear it; so wisdom and knowledge are that setting around the heart which will hold it in the Divine.</P>

      <P>Angels are a part of the Big Self. The infinity has diverse qualities, and specific qualities assume names. They are called Angels. Angels are nothing but a ray of your Big Self. They are there to serve you when you are centered. Like roots and stems and leaves come out of a seed when it is sprouted, all the Angels in your life manifest when you are centered. Angels rejoice in your company, but you have nothing to gain from them. They only come around those who have nothing to gain from them. Angels are like your extended arms. Like all the colors are present in the white sunlight, all the Angels are present in your higher self. Bliss is their breath, dispassion their abode. The consciousness which is bliss, innocence, omnipresent, and the bestower of dispassion is Shiva. Krishna is the outer manifestation of Shiva. And Shiva is the inner silence of Krishna.</P>

    <P>The Governor of Hawaii and the mayor of Honolulu each wrote letters to Guruji welcoming Him and expressing appreciation for Guruji's work in Hawaii. The anxious devotees in Jakarta had made extensive and elaborate reception plans at the airport. Guruji played a trick, with John's help, and arrived one day early, foiling their plans! The new ashram under construction in Jakarta, funded entirely by donations from devotees, will be ready for occupancy in approximately four months. Packed satsangs and packed tummies were enjoyed by all - especially Guruji. The entourage then arrived in Singapore for more celebrations and food and they look forward to a cruise in the Indian ocean. </P>

      <P>Celebrate while you are alone and when you are with people. Some know to celebrate when they are in a crowd. Some can only rejoice alone in silence. I tell you to do both.</P>

      <P>The next day, one of The Art of Living Teachers passed away : Guruji embraced the bereaved family and in minutes lifted the gloom. This experience brought a depth and dispassion in the entire group, and they celebrated singing Jai Jai Radha Ramana Hari Bol . In death, as in life, Guruji was right there at the helm of everything. The entire family will be joining Guruji in Rishikesh.</P>
      <P>Then on to Delhi, the spiritually saturated capital of India, where billboards were seen at every major intersection. The thrilling Satsang and meditation captivated the thousands present.</P>

      <P>Life is utterly simple and yet most complex.  You have to simultaneously attend to both facets of  life.  When life appears most complex, turn to the simplicity.  Simplicity brings peace.  When you are peaceful attend to the complexity within you.  That will make you more skillful.</P>

      <P>If you are only with simplicity, it makes you lazy and dull.  Being only with complexity makes you angry and frustrated.  The intelligent ones balance them and rejoice in both.  If you look only to simplicity, growth is not there.  Looking only at the complexity, there is no life at all.  All that you need is a skillful balance.  If you recognize both simplicity and complexity of life, you will be skillfully peaceful!</P>
      
      <P>Colors are the complexity of life.  White is the simplicity.  When your heart is pure, your life becomes so colorful. </P>

      <P>This primal instinct can be totally transformed through Awareness of Divine Love.</P>

      <P>There are three kinds of Love.  The Love that comes out of Charm, that which comes out of comfort, and the <B>Divine Love</B>.  Do you see what I am saying?</P>

      <P>The love that comes out of charm does not last long.  It comes out of unfamiliarity or out</P>
      <P> of attraction.  In this you lose the attraction fast, and boredom sets in, like most love marriages.  This love may diminish and bring along with it fear, uncertainty, insecurity, and sadness.</P>
      
      <P>The Love that comes out of comfort and familiarity grows.  But this Love has no thrill, no enthusiasm, joy, or fire to it.  For example, you are more comfortable with an old friend who is a familiar person, rather than with a new person.</P>
      
      <P>The <B>Divine Love</B> supersedes both the above.  The Divine Love has ever newness.  The closer you go, there is more charm and depth.  The Divine Love has comfort, enthusiasm, and familiarity.  There is never boredom and it keeps everyone on their toes.</P>
      
      <B><P>Worldly love can be like an ocean, yet an ocean has a bottom.  The Divine Love is like the sky which is limitless, infinite.  From the bottom of the Ocean, soar into the vast sky.</P>

      <P>During a visit to Adichunchunagiri Ashram, Guruji said that this devotees are waiting for him and he must return soon.  &quot;No, let them wait.  Waiting for the Guru is <I>tapas</I> (penance).  Waiting for the world is <I>tapa</I> (torture),&quot; replied the Swamiji of that ashram.  </P>
      
      <P>In the northeastern region at Guwahati, the jubilant crowd of the generally conservative and closed society turned limitlessly wild.  An elaborate banquet for 1500 devotees followed the Satsang.  Four buses and twelve cars with 180 devotees, left for Shillong, the Meghalayan Capital also called &quot;The Scotland of the East.&quot;  En route, the devotees stopped for a picnic on the banks of a large lake and for rides on a speed boat.  All the satsangees of Shillong behaved like an old bunch, though they were meeting Guruji for the first time.  On his return, Calcutta had a Mega Satsang in the Science city auditorium.</P>
      
      <P>P.S.  Guruji has now arrived in Bangalore.  Sukha Nadi (5,000 year old palm leaf scripture) mentioned Guruji's name and that he is the incarnation of Lord Krishna.  There is a temple of Mother Divine 300 km from the Ashram.  The idol of this deity writes and answers questions of devotees.  This deity visited our Ashram and She &quot;wrote&quot; that she was extremely happy about the work of our Ashram.  She also &quot;wrote&quot; that the spirits of both Lord Krishna and the Mother Divine reside in Guruji.  She also &quot;wrote&quot; that all Guruji's devotees are in the most right path and are peaceful, calm, and settled.</P>

And when a person can correct or act, he will never complain. Complaining is a sign of weakness.  Complaining is the nature of utter ignorance where one does not know the Self.  Complaint takes away the Beauty that is inborn in you. And it shows up more on the one who is on this path.</P>

      <P>Worldly mind is a complaining mind; Divine mind is a dancing mind.  Just complaining without indicating the solution is irresponsibility. When the solutions are not workable, finding alternative solutions is Courage.</P>

      </B><P>The Malaysian Advanced Course ended on Sunday and the celebration moved on to Mauritius for the first time. Though preparations for the first visit were on for weeks, all the jigsaw puzzles came to place in the last moment.</P>
      <P>Three grand Satsangs were held with packed halls. The Prime Minister and many Cabinet Ministers also came for the blessings from Guruji. </P>
      <P>It took 200 top police officers and the Commissioner of Police to capture Guruji at the Police Headquarters. The officers all in uniforms were mesmerized by Guruji. They ended up singing bhajans and came to hug and get the blessings from the Master. Many promised to join the Art of Living Satsang group. One of the police officers remarked to Sharda that Guruji is a "stress breaker" but for Sharda and others Guruji is rather a "heart breaker".</P>

    </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Remember that May 13 is Guruj's 41st Birthday! We should start an annual tradition based on last year's birthday surprise which Guruji really liked. At pre-dawn in India (6 to 7 pm U.S. East coast time), we should all join together in silence and meditation to celebrate the incarnation of Grace on this planet. I (Bill Hayden) would like to recommend a Birthday present dear to our Master's heart. We should see how many Dollar-a-Day children that our local communities can support between May 13 and Gurupurnima. We can present this gift to Him at the Gurupurnima celebration. Carla Riechman (our Dollar a Day manager) would like to "keep score" for us and make the presentation to Guruji. Please contact her at 301-588-6422 or laughter@his.com to learn more about this wonderful program and how your community can be a part of His birthday present.</P>

      <P>Pleasure or pain is an intense sensation in the 4 to 6  foot body.  When we are not caught up in this then we are truly and sincerely able to say, &quot;I belong to you.&quot;  That is when all the cravings and aversions, desires and doubts fall off -- and in a moment the world belongs to you.  All your miseries surround the &quot;I, I, I, . . . &quot;, &quot;I want this, I like that, I don't  like this . . .&quot;  Just let go.  The sun rises and sets, the grass grows, the river flows,  the moon shines and I am here forever!</P>

      <P>How do you feel if someone praises you?</P>
      <P>Answer: &quot;Shy, happy, great, embarrassed . . . &quot;</P>
      
      <P>It does something to you, doesn't it?  It doesn't do anything to me!  When you praise the moon, the mountains, Lake Lucerne, the Black Forest . . .it doesn't do anything to them.  They remain the same.</P>
      <P>Just like that I am part of nature.  If you enjoy praising me, you may do so.  In fact, you have no choice!  (Laughter)</P>
      <P>You can do with me whatever you like.  I am there for you.  I am your toy!  (Laughter)</P> 		</font>

      <P>Time literally stood still in Mauritius.  In Satish's house where Guruji stayed, all six clocks and everybody's watches mysteriously stopped!  But anyway, Guruji moved on to South Africa where he addressed enthusiastic crowds in Pretoria and Johannesburg.  Then on to Botswana where Guruji was received by the President at the State House.  Later, Guruji visited a Government Hospital and distributed toys and gifts of clothes and food to the ailing children in the pediatric ward.  The children loved it!  It was Santa Claus but with a black beard and trim tummy!  Guruji distributed blankets and food to the aged and disabled of the entire village of Modipane.  The people were overwhelmed and greeted Guruji with joy and cheer.  Enthusiastic devotees of Botswana's Art of Living are organizing big basic courses and great satsangs.  The tired group went on an African Safari and found two leopards, five  elephants, a vulture with a broken wing, and two monkeys!  The only enthusiastic person was the guide.  The giggling gang went on and on.  Joy knew no bounds and people were forgetting traffic rules as usual.  Hema spooned hot pickle into her tea instead of sugar!</P>
      
      <P>The Ahmedabad chapter organized a blood donation camp and Bangalore organized a mass feeding of the poor.  And in Bad Antogast there was a five story birthday cake with marzipan swans.</P>
      
      <P>Instead of &quot;How are you?&quot; Guruji greeted everyone with &quot;How am I?&quot;</P>

    <P>The miracle of the week is that the angry, reluctant and uncooperative driver of the &quot;Tour de France&quot; bus has become friendly and very patient with the Art of Living circus.  A big transformation has occurred in him by just being with the group.  Now he believes that Guruji is more successful than president Chirac.</P>
    <P>His only puzzle was that whatever Guruji said was so correct, yet the people in the bus were so different.</P>
    <P>The joke of the week is that by the end of the tour, he started serving us to such an extent that he forgot his own baggage.  The Tour de France gave a big boost to the AoL France.  The advanced course has begun in a beautiful Zen temple.</P>

      <P>How can we reconcile the impersonal with the personal? </P>

      <P>In love you raise the object to life. When you love an object it becomes life. For children everything is personal. Children take each object they play with and make it totally personal. Even a stone has a face; even the sun laughs. When you attach emotion, the whole creation becomes personal.  When you remove the emotion, even people become objects. Violence is removing the emotion.  How a person can kill another person: it is when they do not see them as a person, they see them as an object. But even a stone attracts reverence when it becomes personal. </P>
      
      <P>Dean says: In military training they teach soldiers to see people as killing objects coming toward you that need to be killed first. </P>
      
      <P>Susannah says: In the temple even a stone is elevated to the level of spirit. </P>
      
      <P>The impersonal cannot attract reverence. Most people see God as impersonal and therefore they do not progress. </P>
      
      <P>Dean and Susannah say: "That's why we need a Guru!" </P>
      
      <P>Chan says: When we say something isn't real, then it's impersonal. When we personalize</P>
      <P>something, we make it real. So then, what is reality? </P>
      
      <P>You are the Reality. You are not the thoughts, you are not the emotions nor actions. You are not even a person...! </P>
      
      <P>Exercise: What you now see as impersonal, see it as personal. And when you feel any negative emotion towards anybody, see them as impersonal. And pretend that you yourself are a robot. </P>

      <P>The Quebec Ashram fountain is creating rainbows. An advanced course is happening, and the ART Excell course is a big hit with the youth, whose inhibitions are dropping away. As course participants move from the small mind to the Big Mind, the children move super-sized frogs from the small pond to the big lake. Both frogs and humans are happy in their spacious abodes. Vashista makes regular visits each noontime, as we read his ancient teachings in the Yogavasishta.</P>

      <P>To explain everything you do is a burden. Your nature is to shed the burden, and so you don't feel comfortable.</P>
      <P>When you question the reason behind an action, you are asking for justice for yourself. You are creating a distance when you ask for justice. Your whole intention is to come close, but you are creating a distance.</P>
      <P>You are a witness to all your actions. You are as much a stranger to your own actions as you are to someone else's. You are the Eternal Witness.</P>
      <P>When someone asks for an explanation, they are speaking from doership and imposing that doership on you. This brings discomfort. </P>
      <P>If somebody is just there with you, like a part of you, they don't question you. They are like your arm. There is thorough understanding and questions don't arise. </P>

    <P>Question: What do you do if people don't respect you?</P>
<P>Sri Sri Ravi Shankar: Thank them. They have given you freedom. (Laughter and amazement) When people respect you, they often take away your freedom. They expect you to smile at them, recognize them, behave in a certain way with them.</P>
<P>If they don't respect you, you are not obliged to answer their questions and you can drop all the formalities. Either you will be naturally smiling or frowning. So you will be complete.</P>
<P>When people love and respect you, you are obliged to return their courtesies because you don't want to hurt them. When they don't respect or love you, they will not be hurt by your actions and expressions. So they set you free. </P>
<P>When you gain respect, you often do it at the cost of your freedom. Wisdom is to put the freedom first and not bother about respect. </P>
<P>Q: Will freedom not bring arrogance? </P>
<P>A: True freedom is not an "I don't care" attitude. It is lightness from within, a genuine smile and not stiffness. </P>
<P>When someone is stiff and arrogant, they are not really free. True love blossoms only in such freedom. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">And when there is genuine love, respect simply follows you. </P> </B>		</font>

      <P>Sacrifice is letting go of something that you are holding on to or are attached to, which gives you pleasure, for something bigger that would bring good.</P>
      <P>Sacrifice brings strength in life. Life without sacrifice is stagnant. Sacrifice gives you the quantum leap. It takes you to a higher pedestal.</P>
      <P>Often people think sacrifice makes life dull and joyless. In fact, it is the sacrifice which makes life worth living.</P>
      <P>The amount of sacrifice in your life brings out your magnanimity and helps you move out of misery.</P>
      <P>A life without sacrifice is worth nothing. Zeal, enthusiasm, strength and joy are all connected to sacrifice.</P>
      <P>Question: Some people say, "I have sacrificed so much," and complain.</P>
      <P>Answer: That is good. The thought of sacrifice has given them strength to complain and saves them from blaming themselves without which they would even be more depressed.</P>
      <P>Sacrifice never goes unrewarded.</P>
      <P>There can be no love, no wisdom and no true joy without sacrifice.</P>
      <P>SACRIFICE MAKES YOU SACRED. Become sacred!</P> 		</font>

      <P>It is the intellect that divides and that synthesizes. Some creatures in the world only synthesize and some creatures only divide. But the human being has both abilities, he divides and synthesizes. Ants only synthesize, they bring Things Together And Build An Ant Hill. But Monkeys Cannot Synthesize, They Can Only Divide Everything. You Give Them a garland for example, and they tear it to pieces and throw it all over the place. A monkey can only divide, or analyze. But a beaver synthesizes, it brings all the wood together and builds a dam. Birds also synthesize such as the Weaver birds.</P>
      <P>A human being both analyzes and synthesizes. So you analyze from the relative world and synthesize to find the one. The intellect divides to find the truth. Truth once found synthesizes everything.</P>
      <P>When the intellect becomes quiet, it brings out the intelligence. Often people think that gathering information makes one intelligent. This is not so. It is the "<I>samadhi</I>" which brings out the intelligence.</P>
      <P>An unintelligent man, in spite of having all the information, cannot be creative. An intelligent man without much information can be creative.</P>
      <P>A sign of intelligence is to see the one in many and find the many in one.</P>
      <P>There is an old Sanskrit proverb: The first sign of intelligence is not to start anything. The second sign of intelligence is if you have started something, you have to continue it to the end.</P>

      <P>of frustration, ask Who is frustrated?</P>
      <P>Similarly, if you are unhappy, ask Who is unhappy?</P>

      <P>If you think you are ignorant, ask Who is ignorant?</P>

      <P>In the process of its expression, you often get caught up in the object. This is when your sight is caught outside. To return back to your nature, you need insight.</P>
      <B><P>&#9;Pain</B> is the first insight.</P>
      <P>It takes you away from the object and turns you towards your body and mind.</P>
      <B><P>&#9;Energy</B> is the second insight.</P>
      <P>A bolt of energy brings you back to your Self.</P>
      <B><P>&#9;Divine Love</B> is the third insight.</P>
      <P>A glimpse of Divine love makes you so complete and over rules all the relative pleasures.</P>
      <B><P>&#9;Trance</B> is the fourth insight.</P>
      <P>An elevation of consciousness and partial awareness of the physical reality around is Trance.</P>
      <B><P>&#9;Non-dual existence</B>, that all is made up of one and only one, is the fifth insight.</P>

Divine love is the present, yet we are holding onto the paper believing we have already enjoyed the gift. It's like putting the chocolate inside your mouth with the paper still on. A little chocolate may seep into the mouth, but the covering makes sores in the mouth. Unwrap the present. The whole world is there for you to enjoy.

      <P>Note : Indian teachers and Organizers have resolved to start the following Sri Sri Seva Projects ( S S S P) and all the Satsang groups are invited to join in.</P>
      <P>1. Minimum 2% of individual income should be donated towards rural development and hygiene.</P>
      <P>2. Contact your nearest supermarkets / stores and encourage them to use paper or cloth bags instead of plastic bags.</P>
      
      <P>To the USA Satsang Groups</B>:</P>
      <P>As you've recently read in the National Newsletter, Saturday, November 22nd is National Seva Day!!! We encourage all of you to organize and participate in Seva projects in your community as a group. This is a wonderful way to appreciate Guru Dev's message of service, bring the Satsang group closer together, as well as promote the Art of Living as a positive force in the community. </P>
      <P>There are many projects which you can organize. For example, you can volunteer at a local food bank, shelter, or meal distribution center; you can contribute to a convalescence home as visitors to the patients; you can participate in literacy programs for Adult Education or volunteer at schools; and you can affiliate your Satsang with any number of national and local volunteer organizations (such as Habitat for Humanity 1-800-HABITAT, City Cares of America 1-212-533-4734, the Red Cross, the Names Project, etc.). You can be creative--there is so much Seva to be done! You can even look under "Volunteer" in the Yellow Pages! </P>
      <P>Please contact your local teacher for organizational help, and any of us for aid in coming up with ideas, contact information, or anything else we can assist you with! </P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>YOUR EXPRESSIONS OF LOVE</B></P>
      
      <P>You feel a lot of  love for someone and they do not take it. What do you do?</P>

      <P>1. Get frustrated</P>
      <P>2. Turn the love into hatred and wish for revenge</P>
      <P>3. Again and again remind them how much you love them and how little they love you</P>
      <P>4. Become fussy and cranky</P>
      <P>5. Throw tantrums</P>
      <P>6. Feel humiliated and try to protect your respect</P>
      <P>7. Resolve never to love again</P>
      <P>8. Feel hurt and mistreated</P>
      <P>9. Try to be aloof and indifferent</P>
      
      <P>...and you have seen that none of these work. They only make the situation worse. What is the way out of this? How do you maintain your lovingness? </P>
      
      <P>1.Have patience and change your expression of love.</P>
      <P>2. Be centered and limit your expression of love. Sometimes over-expression of love puts people off.</P>
      <P>3. Take it for granted that they love you too and accept their style of expression.  For example, a mother with three kids.  One child talks, one child does not talk, one child throws tantrums.  Mother's love is the same irrespective of their behavior.</P>
      <P>4. Genuinely acknowledge their love for you. This will turn your demand into gratefulness and the more you are grateful in life, the more love comes your way.</P>
      <P>5. Know that hurt is part of love and take responsibility for it. When you move away from your center, you will definitely get hurt and the nature of worldliness is misery.</P> 		</font>

      <P>3. When you get attention (Laughter).</P>
      <P>Ego causes heaviness, discomfort. It doesn't let love flow. Ego can be transcended by knowing the Truth; by enquiring "Who am I?" Often, your attitude towards one who has ego is of contempt or jealousy. But rather you should have compassion, or even pity, isn't it?</P>
      <P>There is also a positive aspect of ego. It drives one to do some work. A person will do a job either out of compassion or out of ego. Most of the work in the society is by boosting the ego. But in Satsang, work is done out of love. Ego is separateness; non-belongingness. It is wanting to prove and to possess. </P>
      <P>And when you wake up and see, there is nothing to be proved and nothing to possess, ego dissolves.</P>

      <P>It is the intellect which harbors inhibitions, likes and dislikes, approvals and disapprovals and it is again the intellect which harbors wisdom, which brings forth the intuition.</P>
      <P>Q: Is intuition beyond intellect?</P>
      <P>Ans: Yes, but it moves through intellect. It's the intellect that lodges wisdom.</P>
      <P>Q: Are emotion and intellect contradictory?</P>
      <P>Ans: They can be contradictory.</P>
      <P>Q: When there is a conflict, which is better?</P>
      <P>Ans: There is no better conflict, in conflict. The pure intellect rises beyond conflicts. The pure intellect is not caught up in the emotional turbulence of the mind. Otherwise the intellect often gets coloured by the emotion and becomes impure like muddy water. Then it is unable to reflect the Self. Whereas pure intellect, still and serene, reflects the Self.</P>
      <P>Q: Is intellect affected by Karma?</P>
      <P>Ans: Karma does not afflict the pure intellect. Liberation is purifying the intellect. The Sanskrit word for intellect is Buddhi and one who is liberated is Buddha.</P> 		</font>

      </B><P>Sri Avtar Hari, a well known Saint from Haridwar, blessed the Ashram and was with Guruji for three days. The Russians, Polish, Chinese and other international groups, left for God's own country - Kerala, with Guruji! The first stop at the state capital Thiruvananthapuram saw a gathering of six thousand people. From there the entourage rode to Cochin. At Cochin, the open ground by the seaside was fabulously decorated. Caparisoned elephants in traditional style and little angels with flowers and lamps accorded a warm welcome. The big ground was packed with around ten thousand people. Imagine how much time it took for the Darshan line! Then on to the cultural capital of Kerala - Thrissur where again over five thousand people gathered for a grand satsang in an indoor stadium. The teamwork at Thrissur was a unique example and this time around, the volunteers felt no pressure; they did very little but a lot happened. The entourage proceeded to Calicut. Not a space even for an ant to crawl at the biggest auditorium in Calicut and many had to be content watching the satsang in the closed circuit television placed outside. </P>
      <P>The volunteers did a marvelous job throughout Kerala. Many healing experiences were reported during Satsangs. Guruji is back in the Bangalore Ashram for an other fortnight.</P>

      <P>When the mind contracts, when it is unhappy, time appears to be too long. When the mind expands, when it is happy, time appears to be too short. When the mind is in equanimity, it transcends time.</P>
      <P>When the mind is dull or unconscious, it is unable to experience itself. When the mind is excited or happy, time seems to be too short and when the mind is miserable, time seems to be too long. To escape from the two extremes, many resort to alcohol, sleep etc..... </P>
      <P>Samadhi, no-mindedness or timelessness, is peace, the Real peace. That is the greatest healer. Time is the greatest healer.</P>
      <P>Just like the mind experiences time, this moment has a mind of its own, a Big Mind which has enormous and infinite organizing power. Thought is nothing but a ripple in this moment, and thus a few moments of Samadhi gives the mind a lot of energy.</P>
      <P>Before you fall into slumber or as soon as you wake up from sleep, in the moments of twilight of Consciousness, experience the timelessness!!</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER">Celebration Is Pure Vibration</P>
    </B><P>Human life is a combination of matter, i.e., body and spirit or vibration. Isn't it? Pleasure or joy is becoming intense vibration. Joy is forgetting that you are matter and so you become intense vibration. All the carnal instincts will also make you feel intense vibrations momentarily. And that's how they give a glimpse of joy. But the thing is, it is short lived and it makes you dense later on. Pleasure that comes from Satsang is of a higher nature. Mantra and singing create vibrations in the spirit. That's why when you sing, the ecstasy stays for a long time. Pleasure in the subtle is long lasting, energizing, refreshing and freeing. Pleasure from the gross is short lived, tiring and binding.</P>
    <P>When you know you are electricity (vibration/energy), then craving, greed, lust and anger disappear. And you become true celebration.</P>
    <B><P>Message for Christmas:</B> You are the Christmas tree. The Christmas tree is pointing upwards and its branches grow on all sides. It is orderly. At the time of year when no tree bears anything, it has many gifts to offer. And it is green throughout the year. A Christmas tree bears the gifts and the lights not for itself. All the gifts you are carrying in your life are for others. Anyone who comes to you, you offer them your gifts.</P>
    <P>There were lots of gifts around Sri Sri's couch. John asked Sri Sri, "Are you going to open the gifts?" Sri Sri winked and pointed at the people and said, "I am always opening the gifts." (Laughter)</P>
    <P>Your life is a gift. And you have come to unwrap the gift. In the process of unwrapping, you also save the wrappers. Your whole environment, situations, circumstances and body are the wrapping papers. When we unwrap, we destroy the wrapping paper. We are in such a hurry at times that we even destroy the gifts. With patience and endurance, open your gifts and save the wrapping papers.</P>

      <P>Desires for sense pleasure are electric in nature and they get neutralized as they move towards the objects of senses. If, by your skill, you could move them within you towards the centre of your existence, another dimension of everlasting pleasure, thrill, bliss, and undying love will all be yours. Lust, greed, power and jealousy are also powerful because they are nothing but energy and you are the source of it - the pure electricity. Dedication and devotion keep the purity of your electricity and they move you upward. </P>
<P>Realizing you are pleasure or electricity yourself your craving subsides and serenity dawns. Remembering that you will die makes you alive now, free from cravings and aversions. The wise is always careful not to get entangled and dizzy in the mind. </P>

      <P>Don't let politics sway you away from the path. If you are afraid of politics you cannot be successful in the spiritual realm. You have to cross the barricade of politics. It is the test of your strength, commitment, and your focus. You <U>cannot</U> avoid politics, but to harbor it in your mind or <U>not,</U> is your choice. There were politics among the 12 apostles, and with Buddha. And Krishna was in politics from head to toe. And you say you don't want politics? The more you don't want it, the more you will harbor it in your consciousness. When you recognize politics in any group or Satsang, that is a blessing for you to be centered and go inward. You can do that without blaming the group and running away from people, or chickening out. It can enhance your skill to act and <U>not</U> get attached. </P>
      <P>Advantages of politics:</P>
      <P>-- Brings up diversity in people.</P>
      <P>-- Puts in front of you different viewpoints, ways, and tendencies.</P>
      <P>-- Enhances your skill to communicate and act.</P>
      <P>-- Brings centeredness and dispassion.</P>
      <P>-- Shakes you up and makes you stand up to the knowledge.</P>
      <P>-- Enhances your capacity to accept and tolerate.</P>
      <P>-- Makes you realize the whole life is a game.</P>
      <P>Cross the threshold of politics and come to the Divine.</P>
      <P>The strong will smile through the politics and the weak will lament.</P>

  <P>Many people think tolerance is a virtue.</P>
<P>Tolerance is a negative term. If you like something you don't have to tolerate. Tolerance indicates a deep sense of dislike, which can at any time turn into hatred. It indicates a sense of separateness . . small mindedness . . limitation of consciousness.</P>
<P>When you are tolerating, it is a temporary state. Tolerance is a potential volcano. If you are tolerating it means you are holding on.</P>
<P>Acceptance is also negative. You accept that which is not lovable.</P>
<P>Question: Don't you need a sense of self-assurance to then go and love people?</P>
<P>This is our company. The Self-Assurance Company. It is only the Self that is always assuring. Nothing else.</P>
<P>Tolerance and acceptance come with judgment and separation. These words which are used, tolerance and acceptance are thought to be positive. I say they are not.</P>
<P>Question: But aren't we supposed to accept people as they are?</P>
<P>If you don't love them, then you have to accept them.</P>
<P>DON'T ACCEPT PEOPLE AS THEY ARE. JUST LOVE THEM AS THEY ARE.</P>

After the interview, the lady said she has to change her whole series which was entitled "Tolerance." Organizers were bewildered as they were unprepared for such a huge crowds at the evening talk. Then Guruji moved on to Panama where a minute-by-minute program was put together by Martine and her team. The celebration moved on to Costa Rica for a day where, in contrast, the hall had enough space for three seats for each person. Satsangs were just a dozen devotees and Guruji fed them all. Then on to Florida where Guruji commented from the beautiful space on the 28th floor, "I am staying in the second best place, the first being my Self!" Then Ronnie Newman had organized a talk sponsored by the Crime Prevention Unit of Nova Southeastern University. It was attended by scientist, researchers, therapists, and justice personnel. It was fabulous!</P>

      <P>If you have all the material securities and not have faith, you will still reel in fear. You have to let go of all possessions in the mind.

      <P>Organization needs attention to details, a material awareness. Organization is being worldly.</P>
      <P>Devotion is getting lost, forgetting the world, being in ecstasy.</P>
      <P>These are opposite in nature. They don't go together, yet they cannot be apart or exist without each other. No organization can arise without devotion. When there is so much devotion, you simply want to organize. Devotion brings faith, compassion, and responsibility. With responsibility and caring, you want to give knowledge, wisdom, and love. Then organization happens. So organization exists through devotion.</P>
      <P>If you are devoted, you won't just sit. The nature of devotion is to give. If you think you are devoted and you are not caring for the world, then you are merely selfish. Real devotion means being one with the Divine, and the Divine cares for the world.</P>

      <P>Blessed are those who don't see a mistake as a mistake....!!!</P>
      <P>But it is hard not to see your own mistake. Outwardly you may justify yourself or prove your innocence to someone else, but a mistake pricks a conscience. Do not justify yourself. Instead, feel the prick of the mistake. That very pinch will take you out of the mistake. </P>
      <P>A mistake means something that brings misery to you in the long run. So why would someone knowingly commit a mistake?</P>
      <P>While pointing out a mistake to someone, do you consider him as separate from you and go on pointing out his error or do you make him feel a part of you? When you point out a mistake to someone, does it make him more stressed, or does it create more awareness in that person? Often you do not point out someone's mistake when it is required. Not pointing out a mistake -- with due consideration to time and place -- is also a mistake.</P>
      <P>When you make a new mistake, it is not a mistake; you have learned a valuable lesson. But when you keep doing the same mistake over and over, it is a <B>BIG</B> mistake. A mistake simply means you have missed taking a lesson that has come your way.</P>
      <P>Do not lament over your mistake. Just take the lesson from it. You will not be judged by your mistakes, but by your virtues. Mistakes are of the earth. Virtues are of the Divine.</P>
      <B><P>Wise is the one who learns from other's mistakes.</P>

Here, as in the old days, there is only the empty seat of the Deity, which signifies the divine beyond form. The Indonesian Director of Religious Affairs and a member of the Ministry of Education welcomed Sri Sri at the opening of our Jakarta Ashram. In an inaugural speech, they said they believed Sri Sri's visit would influence the economic crisis in Indonesia. The very next day, the Indonesian currency (Rupiah) was 30% stronger. The devotees from Jakarta have adopted an orphanage in Puncak, which they visit regularly. The director of the orphanage said that while other people bring money, clothes and toys, our group had supplied the missing nutrient the children needed the most : love! The children each received a package of school supplies and goodies. We all laughed, sang and danced as the director cried tears of gratitude. The entourage moved to Singapore where more than 1,000 people welcomed Sri Sri at the packed SLF Auditorium. The evening commenced with a traditional Chinese lion dance; later Sri Sri gave practical points on "Awakening the Beauty Within You."</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER">Cordiality Is One's Nature</P>

    <P>You cannot eliminate formality in society. It has to be given its place. But devoid of cordiality, formality can be hypocritical. Cordiality alone may cause chaos and may even appear sometimes to be uncaring.</P>
<P>Formality improves communication; cordiality improves communion - oneness. Communication is only necessary where there are two. Formality maintains duality.</P>
<P>Structures are based on formality. Love and knowledge are based on cordiality. For love and knowledge to blossom, you need an informal, cordial environment.</P>
<P>An organization cannot happen, orderliness cannot prevail, if the formalities are abandoned.</P>
<P>All actions are measured steps of formality. Devotion is informal and totally chaotic.</P>
<P>Cordiality is the core of one's existence, formality is the outer shell. When the outer shell is thin, it can reflect the inner light. Like the dome of the lamp softens the light. But if the dome is too opaque, you cannot see the light. So, we need to strike a balance between cordial formality and formal cordiality.</P>

      <P>Ten people were going from one village to another. On the way they had to cross a river. After crossing they wanted to be sure all were there. Each one started counting but counted only nine. They were very distraught and began to cry for the loss of the tenth.</P>
      <P>A wise man came along and asked them "Oh my dear friends, why are you crying?"</P>
      <P>"We were ten but now we are only nine," they replied.</P>
      <P>The wise man saw they were ten, so he asked them to count. Each counted nine but left out himself. Then the wise man made them stand and count, and he said to the last person, "You are the tenth!"</P>
      <P>And they all rejoiced for having regained the tenth.</P>
      <P>Similarly the five senses and the four inner faculties (mind, intellect, memory, ego) all lament when they lose sight of the Self. Then the Master comes and shows you that You are the tenth! Count, but never stop until you find the tenth. The joy is in finding the Ever Present.</P>
      <P>With the knowledge of the Self inside everything is truly joyful.</P>
      <P>Q: What did Brahma think when he made this creation?</P>
      <P>Sri Sri: He didn't think before doing. He didn't take anyone's suggestion -- I would have given him a few.</P>

While being transported, a tape recorder inside was turned on by impact and brought great delight to the volunteers who worked into the early morning to prepare for the departure of the International Advanced Course participants. The course ended with the whole group joining Sri Sri for a dip in the Holy Ganga river. Another Advanced course is already underway in Rishikesh with four hundred participants, while TTC I and II are having a hilarious time. Everything is gearing up the Festival of Colors, Holi.</P>

      <P>All that you are, the love, the beauty, the compassion, the Divinity, doesn't show up fully. What shows up is the crust of behaviors. Ask yourself, "Are you really your behaviors? Are you just your behavioral patterns"? No....... Don't mistake this crust for your inside. </P>
      <P>Neither take the limited body/mind complex as your inside nor show your Infinite Lordship outside, for Divinity is not easily understood. Let there be some mystery. </P>

Sri Sri said The heart is white, the sign of purity in life; the head is orange, the symbol of sacrifice and life is all colorful. Later in the week Sri Sri met with the Shankaracharya and other saints. The school in Bangalore Ashram celebrated its Annual School Day with many local dignitaries along with parents in attendance.</P>
      <P>Many healings were reported this week including a 56-year old man who had lost his vision, reporting after Kriya that he can now read the newspaper; a man who had suffered from abnormal blood pressure for 10-12 years was found to have normal blood pressure after learning Sudarshan Kriya. A 65 year old woman who has not even taken the course, the mother-in-law of a devotee, had a brain hemorrhage and multiple injuries caused by a fall. She was hospitalized on the 10th of January and remained there showing no improvement until the 2nd of March. She was unable to recognize even her own son. On the 2nd of March the doctors said nothing more could be done and gave her six hours to live. A photo of Sri Sri was placed on her bed. Her daughter-in-law held her hand and prayed. The next day, to the amazement of all, most especially the doctors, the blood sugar report, the EEG, the ECG, and all other reports were completely normal and she could recognize everyone. She is now home and managing the house while her daughter-in-law completes TTC.</P>

      <P>When something is unbelievably beautiful or joyful, you wonder whether it is a dream. Often, what you perceive as reality is not joyful and so when misery is there, you never wonder if it is a dream. You are sure it is real. This is knowing the real as unreal and unreal as real. In fact, all the miseries are unreal. A wise man knows that happiness is real, as it is one's very nature. Unhappiness is unreal as it is inflicted by memory. When you see everything as a dream, then you abide in your true nature.</P>
      <P>Payal asks : "What about a nightmare?"</P>
      <P>Sri Sri : A nightmare is a dream mistaken as reality. There is no confusion in a dream at all. Keep wondering whether all this is a dream and you'll wake up to the real.</P> 		</font>

      <FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Do not make an effort to impress others, or to express yourself. Your effort to express yourself becomes an impediment. Your effort to impress someone also becomes futile. If you do not try to impress, expression comes naturally. When you come from the self, your expression is perfect and your impression lasts for ages.</P>
        <P>Often you don't seem to have a control over your impressions and expressions. Wisdom is selecting your impressions and expressions. Enlightenment is when you do not take any impressions at all, whether good or bad. Then you "master" the art of expression. Many impressions in the mind cause:</P>
        <P>- Confusion</P>
        <P>- Distraction</P>
        <P>- Chaos</P>
        <P>- Lack of focus</P>
        <P>- and finally, derangement of the mind.</P>
        <P>Nature has inbuilt in us a system through which it releases some of the impressions - through dreams, and through meditation.</P>
        <P>Excessive expression loses the depth and luster, the serenity of yourself. Meditation erases the impressions and improves the expression.</P>

        <I><P>Kutarka</I> is wrong logic. Most people apply this logic and get caught up in ignorance. For example : The door is half open means the door is half closed. Therefore, the door is fully open means the door is fully closed! </P>
        <P>Or: God is Love. Love is Blind. Therefore, God is Blind!!!</P>
        <I><P>Tarka</I> is sequential logical understanding; it increases scientific knowledge. When sequential logical understanding changes, then scientific conclusions change. For example: Pesticides and antibiotics were considered to be very useful in the past, and are now proven to be more harmful. In <I>tarka</I>, the paradigm changes.</P>
        <I><P>Vitarka</I> is asking questions to which there are no evident answers....Who am I? Where am I? What do I really want? These philosophically appealing questions bring forth spiritual knowledge, increase your awareness and bring about the blossoming of Consciousness, i.e., <I>Atma Gyan</I> increases.</P>
        <P>The wise know to distinguish between the three. They will not apply <I>kutarka</I> or <I>tarka</I> for <I>vitarka, </I>and <I>vitarka</I> for <I>tarka</I>.</P>

<P>Similarly there are two types of forcefulness in people Ö aggression or assertiveness. Some people are forceful in an aggressive manner out of weakness, lack of strength, or out of fear. Others are forceful out of care and love, out of compassion.</P>

      <P>Your whole body is made up of atoms.</P>
      <P>Being with this truth kindles the energy in you and brings up the consciousness. When you sing bhajans, the Sound Energy Vibration Gets Absorbed Into Every Particle Of Your Body.</P>
      <P>Just like a microphone absorbs sound and converts it into electricity, the body absorbs the vibrations and converts it into consciousness.</P>
      <P>When you sit in bhajans your entire body gets soaked in energy and transformation happens. If your are sitting and listening to gossip or violent music, then that gets absorbed by your body and does not give a nice feeling.</P>
      <P>When you hear the Knowledge, or chant with all your heart, that elevates your consciousness.</P>
      <P>There is an ancient proverb in Sanskrit which says that the words of rishis and enlightened ones are translated into experience immediately. </P>
      <P>Bawa says: We have read and heard from so many people, but when Guruji speaks the same knowledge it straight-away hits home.</P> 		</font>

      <P>One of our teachers had an operation after which it was discovered that an absent-minded doctor left a metal clip inside her abdomen. On later examination it was found that in addition to the clip, a large stone developed in the gall bladder and had caused an internal abscess. She was to have surgery on the same day that she had wanted to go to the Bangalore Ashram. That day, when they checked again, the doctors were surprised that there was no clip, no stone and no abscess!</P>
      <P>PS: Guruji was not born, but 2000 people came to the ashram to celebrate his birthday. Prashanth and his housing team were applauded for the way they avoided chaos.</P>
      <P>Ishani and Bawa's dogs also turned vegetarian.</P>

      <P>Attainment Of The Divine Depends On The Intensity Of Longing And Not On The Time And Qualification.</P>
      <P>There is a proverb among the villagers in India, which says that it may take some time to pluck a flower but it takes no time to meet the Divine ! Abilities, qualifications are not the criteria. It is simply the intensity of your longing.</P>
      <P>Intensify your longing for the Divine right away. This you can do when you know that you want nothing and you are nothing.</P>
      <P>Suneeta: If we are nothing and we want nothing, how can longing come? </P>
      <P>Sidappa: Knowing you are nothing and you want nothing brings belongingness:</P>
      <P>....and belongingness intensifies longing.</P>
      <P>Bill: What is the difference between desire and longing?</P>
      <P>Sri Sri: Desire is the fever of the head. Longing is the cry of the heart.</P> 		</font>

      <P>The Ashram is buzzing with activity. One Advanced Course ended and another began, along with the Indian Teachers Meet. Teacher Training Phase 1 and Phase ll and Art Excel too! Ashram housing has overflowed into neighbouring resorts and hostels. Everyone felt the dire need for a bigger meditation hall and dining hall-huge tents were pitched for meditation.</P>
      <P>Even as this shortage was felt, Sri Sri came up with yet another project -Health, Hygiene, Home and Higher states of consciousness- the 4 H's. In less than an hour, inspired devotees took up seva projects to provide drinking water, toilets, prayer halls and over 600 houses for the homeless in the rural districts all over India.</P>
      <P>Vikram: Someone should take up a similar project for the Ashram.</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>FAITH IS YOUR WEALTH</B></P>
      
      <P>Faith is a wealth. If you think, by having faith in God you are doing a favour to God, you are mistaken. Faith gives you strength instantaneously. Faith brings you stability, centeredness, calmness and love. You having Faith In The Guru Or God, Does Not Do Anything To Guru Or God. Your Having Faith Gives You Immediate Strength. Faith is a great wealth; it is a blessing.</P>
      <P>If you lack faith, you have to pray for faith. But to pray, you need faith. This is a paradox. (Laughter)</P>
      <P>People have faith in the world - but the whole world is just a soap bubble. People have faith in themselves - but they don't know who they are. People think that they have faith in God - but they have no idea of God. If you want to doubt, you have to doubt everything</P>
      <P>There are three types of faith : faith in yourself, faith in the world, and faith in God. You need to have faith in yourself -- without faith, you think, I can't do this. This is not for me. I will never be liberated in this life. You must have faith in the world. Without this, you cant move an inch in the world. Banks give you loans having faith that you will pay it back. You deposit money in the bank having faith that it will be returned. If you doubt everything in the world, nothing will happen. The same is the case with faith in the Divine - have faith in the Divine and you will evolve. All these faiths are connected. You must have all three for each to be strong.</P>
      <P>Bill : Atheists have faith in themselves and faith in the world, but not in God.</P>
      <P>Sri Sri : They don't have complete faith in themselves. Lack of faith in God, in the world or in the self brings fear. Faith in the world cannot be constant because there are always changes.</P>
      <P>Faith makes you full - faithful. If you have faith, you are full. </P>
      <P>Rajesh : What is the difference between faith and confidence ? </P>
      <P>Sri Sri : Confidence is the result. Faith is the beginning. </P>
      <P>Faith in yourself brings freedom.</P>
      <P>Faith in the world brings you peace of mind.</P>
      <P>Faith in God evokes love in you.</P>
      <P>You can be at peace by having faith in the world and without faith in God, but it is not complete peace. If you have love, there is automatically peace and freedom. People who are extremely disturbed should only have faith in God.</P> 		</font>

            <B><P>Colourful NEWS SPLASH!</P></B><P> At the close of the Tamil Advanced Course, a satsang was held in the late afternoon in the Sumeru Mandap. After several bhajans, Guruji started chanting. Suddenly people started pointing into the western sky where a huge thundercloud appeared, the top of which was filled with brilliant colours of unusual intensity. The trees had been crying for water and within a few minutes, the wind started and it began to rain. What was it? It was not a rainbow. We contacted the weather observatory, but they had no idea of this phenomenon. When we asked the explanation for this, Guruji said, "Nature is our friend".</P>
      <P>Miscellaneous Newsplashes - After hectic activities in Bangalore, Guruji tried to escape to Mangalore for 24 hours but it turned out to be another party. Art of Living representatives, headed by Sharada Lavingia were invited to the G -8 Summit reception in Birmingham, U.K. Art of Living was also represented in the World Health Organisation Conference in Geneva, Switzerland. Teachers presented programmes in St. Petersburg, Russia. Women's prison programs have started in Bangalore. Reports of more seva projects are arriving from all over the world.</P>

<P>You wake up first. God is still asleep. When you wake up first, you experience pain and pleasure. You become aware of the shortcomings of the world and its beauty. Then you cry for help and seek the ultimate and then you wake up God. And when God is awakened in you, there is no "two." </P>
<P>When both God and you are asleep, there is inertia. When the "I" is asleep, there is no experience. </P>
<P>God is in you in seed form. When he wakes up, you cease to exist. God is asleep in every particle in this universe. It's you who wakes up first and then you awaken God. And when God wakes up, neither you nor the world remain.</P>
<P>The rishis made a mockery. They created a practice of awakening God every morning. They call it Suprabhatam service. Many find this ridiculous because they don't understand the depth of it. Only awakened God can see that God is asleep everywhere. [Laughter.] </P>
<P>Brinda: Why should we wake up?</P>
<P>Sri Sri: Because you are not asleep. If you were asleep, how can you ask the question?</P>

  		<B><P>NEWSFLASH!</B> A tree planting program was begun at the Bangalore ashram. Guruji met with villagers and inaugurated the 4-H program: health, hygiene, home and human values. Satsang groups were started in the villages around the ashram. Guruji travelled from Bangalore to Bombay which was covered with big billboards. The city Satsang attracted over 5,000. When Guruji and entourage arrived at the airport for the trip to Mauritius, we were told the flight was overbooked and we would have to take a later flight. Guruji showed his "Guru card" and suddenly everything worked and all seven travellers had seats on the plane. </P>
<P>Then on to Mauritius where the volunteers did a wonderful job organising many events: interviews with television and radio, two Satsangs, a lecture at the University, audiences with the president and prime minister, and a visit to an old age home (attended by the Minister of Health and Minister of Women). The local Art of Living society has adopted the old age home as a seva project. During his last visit to Mauritius, Guruji captured the police, and this time he met with wardens and other prison officials. Vikram recorded the Seeds of Wisdom at a local radio station, which will broadcast one quote each day for the next month.</P>
<P>This ends the third year of Weekly Knowledge. </P>
<P>Homework for next week: Everyone individually or in their Satsang groups should write the Knowledge for next week and e-mail it to Bill and Anne at stillpoint@erols.com or fax to 301-854-0080.</P>

      <P>We Usually Do Only That Which Is Purposeful, Useful, And Rational. Everything You See, You See Through The rational mind. But an intuition, a discovery, new knowledge goes beyond the rational mind. Truth is beyond the rational mind. </P>
      <P>The rational mind is like a railroad track that is fixed in grooves. A plane has no tracks. It can fly anywhere. A balloon can float anywhere.</P>
      <P>Some people step out of the rational mind in order to rebel against society. They want to break social law but for the ego's sake. They do it out of anger, hatred, rebelliousness, and wanting attention. This is not stepping out of the rational mind (though they think it is).</P>
      <P>We step out of the rational mind when we do something that has no purpose. Accepting that, as an act, makes it a game. Life becomes lighter. If you are stuck with only rational acts, life becomes a burden. Suppose you play a game without a thought to winning or losing, just act irrationally. Making an act without any purpose attached to it - it is freedom - like a dance. </P>
      <P>So just step out of the rational mind and you will  find a greater freedom, an unfathomable depth, and you willl come face to face with reality. Reality transcends logic and the rational mind. Until you transcend the rational mind you will not get access to creativity and the infinite.</P>
      <P>But if you do an irrational act in order to find freedom, then it already has a purpose and a meaning. It is no longer irrational. This knowledge sheet has already spoiled it's own possibility.</P>
      <P>Break the barrier of the rational mind and then find freedom for yourself. </P> 		</font>

      <P>When You Feel Stuck In Life And Not Growing, Bombarded By Desires, When There Is Dryness, Lack Of enthusiasm, no juice, what do you do?</P>
<P>Here is the solution....FEEL GENEROUS....right away, not tomorrow. </P>
<P>Either a princess or a pauper can feel generous. Generosity is the quality of the spirit. When you feel generous your life becomes abundant, full of compassion and love.</P>
<P>Question: Is generosity the same as being grateful?</P>
<P>Answer: No. Gratefulness always has self concern. You are grateful because you have something or you get something. Generosity is an expression independent of external circumstances. No one can make you feel generous. That is something that you have to do yourself. Essentially, generosity is not an act. It is a state of consciousness, but it cannot but find its expression in an act.</P>
<P>Question: What about passion?</P>
<P>Answer: Passion indicates scarcity. Dispassion is abundance. Dispassion without generosity makes you self-centered, causes more dryness.</P>
<P>You dont´ have to think about what you have done in the past. That only brings doership.</P>
<P>Just feel generous. </P>

      <P>Krishna tells Arjuna, "You are very dear to me."</P>
      <P>Then Krishna tells Arjuna he must surrender. Surrender begins with an</P>
      <P>assumption. First you must assume. You assume you are the most beloved of the</P>
      <P>Divine, and then surrender happens.</P>
      <P>Surrender is not an action; it is an assumption. Non-surrender is</P>
      <P>ignorance. Non-surrender is an illusion. So surrender is an assumption.</P>
      <P>Surrender has to begin as an assumption and then it reveals itself as a</P>
      <P>reality. Finally, it reveals itself as an illusion. An illusion because there</P>
      <P>is no two, no duality. </P>
      <P>There is no independent existence of anyone. An individual has no</P>
      <P>independent existence. That is it!</P>
      <P>Question: Do you have to go through surrender to realize it is an illusion?</P>
      <P>Answer: Yes, absolutely.</P>
      <P>Question: Where is choice then?</P>
      <P>Answer: Choice is your destiny.</P>
      <P>Krishna doesn't tell Arjuna in the beginning that he must surrender. First</P>
      <P>he says, "You are so dear to me." And then he tells him, " There is no other</P>
      <P>choice for you, you must surrender. Either you do it now, or you do it later."</P>
      <P>This is the path of love. </P>

      <P>Only in deep rest can the Divine come, not by doing. All the doings are to help you become silent. Not enjoying the bliss or the peace takes you further - otherwise the bliss or the peace can create cravings. If the existence wants to give it, then fine. It takes courage to say "I am". Your true nature is bliss. But trying to enjoy the bliss, you step down from is-ness to am-ness - "l am peaceful", "I am blissful". And that is followed by "I am miserable". "l am" is dispassion. You can be anywhere and be dispassionate. Dispassion is welcoming everything. Centeredness brings energy, a spark. Enjoyment of bliss brings inertia. If you are dispassionate, the bliss is still there. When the freezer is full of ice cream you do not bother about it. Dispassion takes away the sense of scarcity. Passion is a sense of lack of abundance. And whenever everything is abundance, dispassion happens. And when dispassion is there, everything comes in abundance. </P>
      <P>Q: What do we do when we catch ourselves enjoying our bliss?</P>
      <P>Guruji: Then we feel stupid. Just an understanding we are enjoying it, creates a shift. There is no effort. Knowledge is better than action to make you free.</P>

      <P>Mercy indicates lack of intimacy. Indicates a distance; a lack of belongingness. You don't have mercy on your near and dear ones. You don't hear parents say, "l have mercy on my children." You have mercy on those who you think are not yours. Mercy indicates anger, judgment and authority. When you ask for mercy, you are self- centered. You want to be excused from the law of cause and effect. It also indicates lack of courage and valor.</P>
<P>At times mercy is an impediment to growth. Mercy, of course, brings some comfort and relief; but can impair the process of transformation. If the leaves were to ask for mercy from falling, they would not be transformed. </P>
<P>If someone is driving and is tired, they will stop at the rest area. But if they start living there, they will be arrested (laughter). Then the spot has not served its purpose.</P>
<P>Patti and Victoria, high on bliss, did not stop at the stop sign and the police mercilessly gave them a ticket (in India-memo). Do you know what? Victoria said, "Thank you." But the police woman told her to go to court and ask for mercy! (laughter)</P>
<P>When you know and trust the process of creation, you will simply rejoice. It is the small mind which superimposes its nature on the Divine mind. Only when you made a mistake and you think God is angry and judging you do you ever ask for mercy. The Divine is all knowing and all loving; there is no chance for mercy. </P>
<P>Do you know I have no mercy? When there is intimacy there is no place for mercy.</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>LOYALTY</B></P>
      
      <P align="justify">Loyalty is the way in which a mature and integrated mind behaves. 
        Loyalty indicates undivided wholeness of consciousness and shows richness of 
        the mind. When the mind is not integrated it is feverish, disloyal and opportunistic. 
        Disloyalty comes out of opportunism. Opportunism is short-sightedness of one's 
        destiny. Integrity or wholeness is essential to be healthy. A divided mind will 
        gradually lead to schizophrenia and other physical and mental disorders. Loyalty 
        is a real strength and will have the support of nature in the long run.</P>
      <P align="justify">Fear and ambitions are impediments to loyalty. Loyalty is needed 
        both in the material and spiritual plane. Either to destroy, create or maintain 
        any institution, group or society, loyalty is essential.</P>
      <P align="justify">Loyalty means believing in the continuity of commitment. Honouring 
        commitment is loyalty. It takes you beyond the duality of craving and aversion.</P>
      <P align="justify">Responsibility, dedication, commitment are the limbs of loyalty. 
      </P>
      <P align="justify">A loyal mind is a 'yes'-mind. The purpose of asking questions 
        is to get an answer. The purpose of all answers is to create a ...'yes'.... 
        'Yes' is an acknowledgement of knowledge. The 'yes'-mind is a quiet, holistic 
        and joyful mind. The 'no'-mind is a agitated, doubting and miserable mind. Loyalty 
        begins with a 'yes'-mind and starts to perish with a 'no'-mind. </P>

      <P align="justify">You can love someone for their qualities and not feel a sense

        not the case when love arises out of kinship.</P>
      <P align="justify">If you love someone for their qualities, then when the quality 
        changes or you get used to the quality, love also changes. However, if you love 
        someone out of kinship, because they belong to you, then that love remains for 
        life-times.</P>
      <P align="justify">People say "I love God, because He is great". This is no big 
        thing. If God is found to be ordinary, just one of us, then your love for God 
        collapses! If you love God, because He is yours, then however God is, whether 
        He creates or destroys, you still love Him. The love for kinship is like the

      If love is based on the quality of a person, then the love is not stable - after 
      sometime the qualities change and the love becomes shaky. Loving someone because 
      of their greatness or uniqueness is Third-rate love. Loving someone because they 
      belong to you, great or otherwise, is unconditional love.
      <P align="justify">Knowledge, Sadhana, Seva and Satsang help to bring about a 
        sense of belonging in no time. When love springs forth from a sense of belongingness 
        then the actions and qualities do not over shadow the love. Neither the qualities 
        nor actions can be perfect all the time. Love and a feeling of kinship alone 
        can be perfect.</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>SINGING, COMMUNICATION AND EGO</B></P>
      
      <P align="justify">There are three modes of communication: in head to head communication 
        you talk, in heart to heart communication you sing, and soul to soul communication 
        happens in silence.</P>
      <P align="justify">When you meet with people, often you communicate from head 
        to head. When you are with nature, you start singing, you communicate with nature 
        from your heart. Often when you are with people you keep talking, blabbering, 
        and you keep the communication on the level of the head only. But when you are 
        with nature, you start humming and your communication comes through the heart. 
        And when you are with the guru, you go blank and forget all the questions. Then 
        communication comes through the soul in silence.</P>
      <P align="justify">When you meet with people, you like to remain in the head, 
        you seldom sing with people (other than when it is organised). Your ego obstructs 
        you from singing. Many do not feel comfortable singing with people. When you 
        sing with people then you descend to the heart level or feeling level. Some 
        feel comfortable just listening to music. Some feel comfortable singing only 
        when they are alone. Some sing to draw attention or to charm others. Some only 
        want to join in when all the others are singing. All this singing comes from 
        ego. </P>
      <P align="justify">Bhajan means sharing, sharing from the deepest level of our 
        existence. Bhajan is authentic sharing. If you could sing with people, then 
        your ego shatters. Children can sing with people for they do not have ego. To 
        sing with a stranger you have to be free of ego. Ego doesn't let you sing with 
        a stranger. Head level is safe for the ego -heart level breaks the ego - soul 
        level dissolves the ego. All communication gaps happen because of ego.</P>
      <P align="justify">Exercise: when you are with people, rather then chatting just 
        start singing and you can feel the shift of energy that is happening. If you 
        want to have more fun, greet a stranger with a song. </P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>EXPANSION OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS PEACE</B></P>
      
      <P align="justify">Consciousness moving on the surface of the body is stimuli, 
        which cause pleasure. When consciousness shrinks, then the sensation of pain 
        and suffering arises. Suffering is the shrinking or contraction of consciousness.</P>
      <P align="justify">When consciousness moves through the body in limited channels, 
        pleasure is experienced. Repeated enjoyment of the stimuli causes inertia and 
        dullness. Often cooks don't enjoy their own food. Listening to the same piece 
        of music loses the charm, people in the sex industry don't enjoy sex. If the 
        stimuli are observed, then consciousness expands and becomes peace. With awareness 
        the stimuli lose their significance; whether they exist or not makes no difference. 
        When the sun is there, then whether the candle is lit or not makes no difference. 
        To realise that all pleasures are just stimuli and that you are more than the 
        stimuli brings freedom.</P>
      <P align="justify">Pain is nothing but consciousness wanting to expand and to 
        become free. Freedom basically is liberation from the craving of the stimuli. 
        Pain is not a permanent state. The natural tendency of consciousness is to expand, 
        to become bliss. Like the natural tendency of water is to flow downward, and 
        the natural tendency of air is not to be under pressure, the natural tendency 
        of consciousness is to expand and to be at peace. Like the person who is an 
        insomniac and has forgotten how to sleep, most of us have forgotten to be at 
        peace and in bliss.</P>

        ... visit to the Tamilian Sri Lankan temple in Oslo ... public lectures in Sweden 
        ... it was always the same: everyone blissfully cried out "please stay longer". 
        Guruji visited Finland for the first time for a total of 15 hours. In this short 
        time, he made the headline news on the main television channel. Several people 
        dreamed of Sri Sri even before hearing about him. Many people signed up for 
        the basic course.In Hamburg, Guruji addressed the oldest Rotary Club of Europe 
        along with a blissful Satsang in a fully packed church which left everyone spell-bound. 
        Welcoming Guruji, the priest said "It is time to open the church doors for real 
        spiritual knowledge". </P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>DEPENDENCE, INDEPENDENCE, INTERDEPENDENCE AND ONENESS</B></P>
      
      <P align="justify">The body is dependent on the whole creation. In society, somebody 
        has to make clothes, produce electricity, drill for oil. The body cannot be 
        independent of the world. For the body, dependency is absolute. When the Spirit 
        identifies with the body, then it gets pinched and looks for independence. Mind, 
        intellect, ego - they all look for independence.</P>
      <P align="justify">In looking for independence often you get stuck in the ego 
        and become more miserable. Most people are not aware of their dependency. When 
        they become aware of their limitations and dependency, the desire for independence 
        arises. Independence cannot be achieved unless you start moving from within. 
        When you move within, you discover that you are interdependent. Individual Self/Soul/Jeeva 
        is interdependence and in fact every wise person knows that everything is interdependent 
        and that there is nothing like independence. </P>
      <P align="justify">On one level dependency is a harsh reality. On another level, 
        it is an illusion because there is nothing else but the Self. It's only when 
        you don't feel oneness, belongingness that you want independence. The Self being 
        non-dual, there is no question of dependence or independence. One who asks for 
        independence is a beggar. One who knows that it is an illusion is a King. When 
        the sense of belongingness is not well founded, then there is a volatile state 
        in the life of a seeker. Then the ego finds some excuse to revert to smallness. 
        It is not yet totally soaked in the totality of knowledge. As it is not used 
        to it, the mind finds every little excuse to revert back to the ego and to be 
        aloof and independent and separate and it would find any small fault and blow 
        it out of proportion. Be aware of these tendencies and come what may, be strong 
        in the commitment to the Satsang, the Path. </P>

      <P align="justify"> In the past 240 days, Sri Sri visited 92 places. In the ashram 
        in Germany, TTC1 and TTC2 were in jubilee, the basic course was like an advanced 
        course. Assisted by the official Polish government interpreter, Guruji addressed 
        an enthusiastic audience of 1,700 in Warsaw. Everything was arranged professionally 
        and elegantly. There were about 1,000 people including VIPs and the TV crews 
        who could not get in. It took great skill and effort for the organisers to pacify 
        them. From there 450 people have moved to the scenic Muszyna camp for an advanced 
        course.</P>

      <P align="justify">Activity and rest are two vital aspects of life. To find a 
        balance in them is a skill in itself. When to have what and how much to have 
        is wisdom. Finding them in each other-activity in rest and rest in activity-is 
        the ultimate freedom. </P>
      <P align="justify">More tiring than the work itself is the memory of hard work. 
        Thinking you have worked hard itself interferes with the quality of rest. Some 
        people take pride in working hard without any results. And there are others 
        who crave for long rest not knowing the rest is in non-doership. It is the quality 
        of rest, even if it is short, that recuperates. </P>
      <P align="justify">When rest is needed, your body will automatically take it. 
        Resting, without thinking about the need for it, is more restful. Desirelessness, 
        Dispassion, and Samadhi are the deepest rest.</P>

        tiring nor frustrating. For example, daily routines like brushing one's teeth 
        or bathing are not even considered actions because they are so integrated into 
        one's life. You do all this without doership. When Seva is made part of your

        The advanced course in Junagadh had 500 people and was indescribable. Sri Sri 
        attended 4 to 5 Satsangs each day in different part of the city. Excellent teamwork 
        and arrangements made for a electrifying Satsang in Rajkot with over 7000 people. 
        Guruji made a great escape after tearing the decorations, jumping off a wall, 
        getting into his car without his sandals and driving through fields. The latest

        paper that is space, with ink that is love, written in a language that is silence. 
        How many of you got it?</P>
      <P align="justify">Navarathri was celebrated in the Ashram by hundreds of devotees 
        from all around the world. Silence made way for celebrations that got louder 
        and louder, culminating in a wave of bliss.</P>
      <P align="justify">Serious discussions are under way for expanding the facilities 
        in the Ashram. Even though the volunteers and the housing team did an excellent 
        job, the need for more rooms and a larger Meditation Hall was direly felt. You 
        are welcome to send in your suggestions and contributions directly to the Ashram.</P>

          you are hollow and empty is totally different.</font></p>

        Although "there is no way," Guruji nonetheless gave some interesting clues about 
        "the way" in a spontaneous discourse this week on the eight limbs of yoga. Following

      <P align="justify">Sri Sri theoretically is on vacation this week at the Montreal 
        Ashram. To the untrained eye, however, his so-called vacation appears no different

        the greatest mystery. </P>
      <P align="justify">Guruji is visiting Halifax and surprised the devotees of Halifax. 
        Halifax is far from Montreal and many devotees were unable to come to the ashram 
        to see him. Guruji continually confirms in so many ways that he is indeed the 
        embodiment of love and compassion.</P>

        it because it is a normal act for her. In the same way, you appreciate getting 
        a ride from someone you don't know, but you don't necessarily appreciate it 
        from a bus driver.</P>
      <P align="justify">In all these cases, those acts are temporary, out of character,

        talk. Kobe had a beautiful Satsang, then the group went to Tokyo and Guruji 
        stayed with his classmate. Laudable team work made possible exuberant Satsangs

        1000 people. </font></P>

      <P>Our first and foremost commitment is to do seva (service) in 
        the world.<br>
        If there is fear in your life, it is because of a lack of commitment. <br>
        If there is confusion in your life, it is because of lack of commitment. </P>
      <P>The very thought I am here in this world to do seva (service), 
        dissolves the i and when the i dissolves, worries dissolve. Seva is not something 
        u do out of convenience or for pleasure. The ultimate purpose of life is to 
        be of service.</P>
      <P>An uncommitted mind is miserable. A committed mind may experience 
        rough weather but will reap the fruits of its toil.</P>
      <P>When you make the service your sole purpose in life, it eliminates 
        fear, brings focus in your mind and purposefulness, action and long term joy 
        and may be short term problems!</P>

      <P>Austerity is often mistaken to be poverty, self-denial. It 
        is neither.<br>
        Austerity comes out of maturity. It is a sign of social health. <br>
      </P>
      <P>Often people who practice austerity are resentful of richness. 
        This is a very pitiable state. Such austerity is not born out of maturity but 
        out of compulsion. The true austerity has tolerance for richness and is never 
        resentful.</P>
      </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"> 
      <P ><font face="Arial"> In fact, one who is mature will have pity 
        for one who is not austere. Austerity is not against celebration and just vanity 
        is not celebration.</font></P>
      <P >Celebration dawns in the spirit. Only one who is rich in spirit 
        can practice austerity. One may be rich materially but if he is poor in spirit 
        he can neither celebrate nor evolve.</P>
      <P >Poverty of spirit is vanity. Austerity brings freedom from 
        the pride of vanity. But taking pride in austerity is again a vanity !</P>
      <P >Austerity comes out of abundance, and austerity brings abundance. 
        If you feel a lack in any area of life, immediately start austerity. Austerity 
        not only brings freedom but nurtures sharing and caring.</P>

      <P align="justify">You can be at ease with the uncertainty of the world when you 
        realise the certainty of the consciousness. Often people do just the opposite. 
        They are certain about the things in the world and uncertain about God. They 
        rely on something that is not reliable and get upset. Uncertainty causes craving 
        for stability and the most stable thing in the universe is our Self.<br>
      </P>
      <P align="justify">The world is of change, the Self is of non-change. You have 
        to rely on the non-change and accept the change. If you are certain that everything 
        is uncertain, then you are liberated. When you are uncertain in ignorance then 
        you become worried and tense. Uncertainty with awareness brings higher states 
        of consciousness and a smile.</P>

      <P align="justify"> Bharat says: A certain smile!!!</P>
      <P align="justify">Often people think that certainty is freedom. If you feel that 
        freedom when you are not certain then that is 'real' freedom. Often your certainty 
        or uncertainty is based on the relative world. To be certain about the uncertainty 
        of the relative, makes you certain about the existence of the absolute and brings 
        a 'certain' faith in the absolute. Nitin says: Yes, to understand this you certainly 
        need to have awareness!!!</P>

        old - the Alps, the water, the air. Billions of people have breathed the same 
        air. All the particles in your body are old, you are recycled. Your thoughts 
        and emotions are recycled, mind is recycled. You are a recycled person.<br>

      <P align="justify">Everything here is recycled. Consciousness is recycled - its 
        the same old consciousness. Remind yourself that everything here is recycled 
        material - so relax! Everything goes to where it came from. Recycling brings 
        back purity and hygiene. Knowledge recycles the mind.</P>

      <P align="justify"><font face="Arial">After a grand satsang in Madras the group 
        went to the Chidambaram temple, the place of the cosmic dance of SHIVA. Then 
        on to the temple town of Kumbakonam for a big satsang, also known as the seat 
        of Vedic knowledge, where Guruji honored many Vedic pundits and meditations 
        were held in many ancient temples. Then the satsang army marched on to Papanasam, 
        Guruji's birthplace, where everyone played in the water - shooting missiles 
        of bliss. Then on to Trichy for an invigorating satsang. People were well fed 
        up in the temples. In spite of the tour being hectic the whole group of 80 was 
        so energetic and enthusiastic. Guruji was received by the temple authorities 
        at the Sri Rangam temple and honored by the pontiff of the Vaishnava tradition, 
        who was visibly moved. Then the troupe moved on to Madhurai where the elephants 
        garlanded Guruji to the beat of the drums on the premises of the famous Minakshi 
        temple, for a jubilant satsang with more than 8000 people who were spell-bound 
        in a great meditation. Next morning the entire town of Rajapalayam celebrated 
        a long awaited (seven years) satsang with Guruji. Before noon the group left 
        for Udimalpet where many seva projects had been launched. Again a big satsang 
        with several 1000 people. The next morning there was a live kriya and satsang 
        for about 2500 people and the group went to Pollachi for the grand, final satsang 
        of the tour. Then the caravan of buses and cars left for Bangalore and Guruji 
        left for Madras, where a gentlemen came to meet him with an ancient, 5000 year 
        old palm leaf script which mentioned the name of Guruji, and the immense grace 
        that flows through him and protects and transforms the life of millions. Then 
        Guruji came to the European ashram Bad Antogast in Germany. Several advanced 
        courses and seva projects are happening around the world this week - as usual 
        - not to mention the joy and celebration. </font></P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>BLISS</B></P>
      
      <P>Bliss cannot be understood.  It is extremely difficult to get into bliss.  After many lifetimes you get into bliss. It is even more difficult to get out of bliss.  All that you seek in your life is bliss, that divine union with your source, and everything else in the world distracts you from that goal.  There are a zillion things to distract you from that goal in so many ways.  So many unexplainable, incomprehensible ways of not coming home.</P>

      <P>The mind is kept alive by cravings and aversions - shoulds or should nots and wants.  Only when the mind dies does the bliss dawn.  Bliss is the abode of all divinity, all devas.  It is possible only in this human body to comprehend, to uphold, and having had a human life and having known this path, if you still do not realize this - you are at the greatest loss.  The cravings and aversions make your heart hard.  There is no use in being polite in your behavior. You can be rude in your behavior but you cannot be rough in your heart.  If you are rude in your behavior, it is acceptable, but not if you are rough in your heart.  The world does not care how you are inside.  It only looks to your behavior.  The Divine does not care how you are outside – It only looks to your inside.  Never let any tiny bit of dislike or craving house in your heart.  Let it be fresh, soft and fragrant like a rose.</P>
      
      <P>It is such an illusion – you dislike someone or something, and this only makes you hard and your hardness takes a long time to soften, to disappear.  It is such a trap for keeping you away from the treasure.  Nothing in this material world can give you contentment.  An outer-looking mind seeking for contentment gets discontented and the discontentment grows, and complaints and negativity start hardening the brain, clouding the awareness (the aura), and forming a huge cloud of negative energy.  When the negativity reaches its peak, like an overloaded balloon, it bursts and comes back to the Divinity.  You can never escape the Divine, the long route of negativity, or the instantaneous positive approach.  When the Divinity dawns, in no time the shift happens from the untruth to truth, from darkness to light, from the dull inert matter to the sparkling spirit.  When the heart is hard, there is no fun.  You cannot experience fun.</P> 		</font>

<P>NEWS FLASH</P>

</B><P>The Poland  Art of Living distributed 76,000 kgs of milk powder to homeless children.  Russia reports that the Art of Living course is now a part of the curriculum at the University of Irkutsk in Siberia, Russia.  Guruji's tour of the Netherlands began with a noontime talk at the University of Maastricht to an overcrowded hall with no room to even stand.  The group continued to Amsterdam, where he gave a great talk on Human Values to 140 diplomats, ministers and ambassadors representing 20 countries.  The next evening, a public talk was held in a beautifully decorated hall with melodious music and marvelous meditation and everyone was in bliss.  There was an art exhibit on Human Values and the atmosphere was filled with joy and enthusiasm.  The group then moved on to Rotterdam, where Guruji completed the tour with a talk to the Indian community and everyone present was shining as brightly as decorations.</P>

      <P>Do you welcome all that comes to you or do you resist it? If you cannot resist anything, you cannot welcome anything!   You cannot resist everything and you cannot welcome everything!</P>

      <P>You don't welcome all thoughts that come to your mind.  When you welcome a thought, it means you find it good and act on it.  If you act on all thoughts that come to your mind, you will end up in a mental hospital or in prison.  So, you resist or ignore some thoughts and welcome other thoughts.  You need discrimination in life.  Welcoming and resisting is a swing in life.</P>
      
      <P>Welcoming is essential for expansion and growth, and resistance is essential for maintenance.</P>
      
      <P>Audience:  But what you resist persists!</P>
      
      <P>Guruji:  If you resist a cold it does not persist!  If there is no resistance in your body you cannot survive.  Your body resists something and welcomes something.</P>
      
      <P>Where the resistance is weak, the persistence happens.  A weak resistance makes the opposition persist.  A strong resistance erases the opposition.  Strong resistance leads to valour, power and samadhi (equanimity).  It brings in you the strength of a warrior. Nothing can tempt you, nothing can obstruct you.   Then the victory is gained without fighting.  Where there is strong resistance or total welcome, the victory is gained without any fighting.</P> 		</font>

      <P>  When a part of the body is stimulated, pleasure arises.  When your soul is stimulated, love arises. Love has no end but pleasure ends.  Often people think pleasure is love.  Distinction between pleasure and love has to be understood, only the luckiest one will understand.</P>

      <P>All that one wants is the stimulation of the soul.  Even a faint idea of it keeps life going.  Every other stimulus is on the surface.  The stimulus of the soul energizes and the stimulus of the body brings tiredness.  Every stimulus should lead you to the self so that when you listen to music, you transcend the music, and when you listen to Knowledge it takes you to the Silence.  </P> 		</font>
