    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>THIS BEGINS A NEW PRACTICE</B></P>
    <P>This begins a new practice of weekly dispatches of Knowledge from Guruji. Every center around the world will receive the Knowledge so it can be read for people to copy down at weekly Satsang. Here is the first segment Guruji dictated at Big Sur, 21 June, 1995.</P>
    <P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * *</P>
    <P>Beyond an event is Knowledge.&#9;</P>
    <P>Beyond a person is love.</P>
    <P>Beyond an object is infinity.</P>
    <P>Knowledge is not in an event; it is beyond an event.</P>
    <P>If you take one event and infer anything from one event -- infer knowledge -- it will be erroneous knowledge. Say Nancy gets angry and shouts at someone. You attribute anger to Nancy, but actually it was carried from someone else to her. Someone else got angry first and someone else and someone else and on and on like that.</P>
    <P>When you go beyond an event, only then the truth dawns. One particular event gives you a false notion. So you have to consider the totality of events, the totality of all events infinitely. Beyond the event is Knowledge.</P>
    <P>What do we call a person? A person is a body, a mind, a complex of behaviors which is changing. Love is unchanging. Beyond the person is love.</P>
    <P>When you lose your personality, you become love. If you cannot lose yourself, you cannot find yourself. So, lose your personality; you'll find yourself!!!</P>
    <P>Behind every object is infinity. An object is limited. Take an object and reduce, reduce, reduce, and you have an atom. An atom is infinity. Each atom contains infinite space. Beyond the object is infinity.</P>
    <P>The object behind the object is infinity. The person behind the person is love.</P>
    <P>Maya is getting caught up in the event, personality, object. Knowledge, love, Brahman is seeing beyond the event, personality, or object. See? Just a little shift.</P>

          <P>  हर व्यक्ति के परे प्रेम है । व्यक्तित्व बदलता है । शरीर, मन और व्यव्हार हमेशा बदलता है। हर व्यक्तित्व से परे अपरिवर्तनशील प्रेम है ; वह प्रेम तुम हो । जब स्वयं को खो दोगे , तो स्वयं को पा लोगे ।</P>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>CLOSE TO THE MASTER</B></P>
    <P>If you're not feeling close to the Guru, it's because of you. Because of your mind, because of your ego concepts. Share with the Guru that which is very important or intimate to you. Share that. Do not feel shame, shy, or judgmental about yourself. </P>
    <P>Unless you express to the Master that which is very intimate and important to you, just being on the formal and informal communication levels cannot make you feel close. "How are you, where are you going? How have you been?" Stop formal and superficial conversations with the Master and speak with your heart that which is very important and intimate, very deep to your life. Don't just say how much the squash costs, 30 cents or whatever.</P>
    <P>If you don't feel close to the Master, there's no point in having a Master. It is just another burden to you. You have enough already. Just say "Goodbye," get rid of it.</P>
    <P>Question: When you play little games and push us away, how can we feel close to you?</P>
    <P>Answer: You should feel more close if you are pushed away, scolded or ignored. Because to ignore somebody takes a lot of effort. When a Master does not even ignore wrapping paper, or a flower that is in a vase, how can he ignore a walking, talking, breathing human being who is connected? How could that be ignored? So when you understand this, you already feel close.</P>
    <P>Question: Can we call you every week?</P>
    <P>Response from the room: Call Guruji every week and if he doesn't answer the phone then you know you are loved.</P>
    <P>Answer: Yes, put that in. &#9;(Laughter)</P>
    <P>You are with the Master to share the joy of the Master, to share the consciousness of the Master. For that, you have to empty your cup of what is already in it. So you share that with the Master. You share whatever you have and don't judge, "Oh, that is garbage." The Master is ready to accept any garbage of any extent. However you are, he will embrace you. He is ready to share. You only have to share from your side.</P>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>गुरु के समीप</B></P>
    <P>&nbsp;</P>
    <p>यदि तुम खुद को गुरु के निकट अनुभव नहीं कर रहे हो, तो इसका कारण तुम ही हो।</p>

<p>तुम्हारा मन, तुम्हारा अहंकार तुम्हे दूर रख रहा है । जो कुछ भी तुम्हारे लिए महत्वपूर्ण है, अंतरंग है, उसे गुरु के साथ बाँट लो, बता दो । संकोच मत करो, शरमाओ नहीं, इस पर स्वयं अपना निर्णय मत लो। </p>

<p>यदि तुम अपनी आंतरिक व महत्वपूर्ण बातें गुरु को नहीं बताओगे, केवल साधारण शिष्टाचार वाली बातें करोगे, तब उनके साथ निकटता का अनुभव नहीं कर सकोगे। "आप कैसे है? कहाँ जा रहे है। सब कैसे चल रहा है?" ऐसी नियमित और ऊपरी बातें गुरु के साथ मत करो। अपना हृदय खोलकर मन की गहराईयो में समाई आंतरिक व महत्वपूर्ण बातें करो। सिर्फ यह मत कहो की शरबत की बोतल का दाम क्या है ।</p>

<p>यदि तुम गुरु से निकटता अनुभव नहीं कर रहे  हो, तो उन्हें गुरु मानने की आवश्यकता क्या है? वह तुम्हारे लिए एक और बोझ है। तुम्हारे लिए ऐसे ही बहुत से बोझ हैं । बस अलविदा कह दो।</p>

<p>प्रश्न: जब आप ही हमें कभी-कभी दूर रखते हैं, हम आपके साथ निकटता कैसे अनुभव करें?</p>
<p>श्री श्री: यदि तुम्हें दूर रखा जाए, डाँटा जाए, तुम्हारी ओर न देखा जाए, तो और अधिक निकटता अनुभव करो। क्योंकि किसी की उपेक्षा करने के लिए भी बहुत प्रयत्न करना पड़ता है। जब गुरु किसी उपहार के सुन्दर आवरण, अथवा गुलदस्ते में रखे हुए एक फूल की  भी उपेक्षा नहीं कर सकते है, तो फिर वह एक चलते फिरते, बोलते,साँस लेते व्यक्ति की, जो उनसे जुड़ा है, कैसे उपेक्षा कर सकते हैं ? जैसे ही तुम इसे समझ जाओगे, निकटता का अनुभव होने लगेगा।</p>

<p>टौर: क्या हम हर सप्ताह आपसे फ़ोन पर  बात कर सकते हैं ?</p>
<p>केनी: गुरूजी को प्रति सप्ताह फ़ोन कीजिये और यदि वे आपसे बात न करें तो समझ लीजिए कि वे आपको प्यार करते हैं।</p>

<p>श्री श्री: हाँ, यह ठीक हैं । ( हसी )</p>
<p>तुम गुरु के साथ उनके आनंद, उनकी चेतना के सेहभागी हो । इसके लिए तुम्हें अपने आप को खाली करना पड़ेगा ।</p>

<p>जो भी है, गुरु को बताओ और यह मत सोचो- " यह तो कूड़ा है "। गुरु तुम्हारे मन के सरे कूड़े को लेने के लिए तैयार है। तुम जैसे भी हो, वे तुम्हें सीने से लगा लेंगे। वे तुम्हारा बोझ हल्का करने के लिए तैयार हैं। अपनी ओर से उसे देने के लिए तुम्हें तैयार होना हैं ।</p>

    <P>Some karma can be changed and some cannot.</P>
    <P>When you prepare halwa, if sugar is less or ghee is less, water more or less, it can all be adjusted, repaired. But once soji is cooked, it cannot be reversed.</P>
    <P>If the buttermilk is sour, milk can be added, salt can be added to make it drinkable. But it can never be reversed back to milk.</P>
    <P>Prabdha karma cannot be changed. Sanchita karma can be changed by spiritual practices. Satsang burns the seed of all negative karma.</P>
    <P>When you praise someone, you take on their good karma. When you blame someone you take on their bad karma.</P>
    <P>Know this and surrender both good and bad karma to the Divine and be free.</P>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>प्रारब्ध कर्म तथा संचित कर्म</B></P>
    <P>&nbsp;</P>
    <p>कुछ कर्म बदले जा सकते हैं और कुछ नहीं।</p>

    <p>जैसे हलवा बनाते समय चीनी या घी की मात्रा काम हो, पानी अधिक या कम हो, उसे ठीक किया  जा सकता है। पर हलवा पक जाने पर उसे फिर से सूजी में नहीं बदला जा सकता।</p>
    <p>मट्ठा यदि अधिक खट्टा हो, उसमे दूध अथवा नमक मिलाकर पीने के लायक बनाया जा सकता है , पर उसे वापस दूध में बदला नहीं जा सकता</p>
    <p>प्रारब्ध कर्मों को नहीं बदला जा सकता। संचित कर्मो को आध्यात्मिक अभ्यासों के द्वारा बदला जा सकता है। सत्संग के प्रभाव से सभी बुरे कर्मों के बीज अंकुरित होने के पहले ही नष्ट हो जाते है।</p>
    
    <p>जब तुम किसी की प्रशंसा करते हो, तुम्हें  उसके अच्छे कर्मों  का फल मिल जाता है ।</p>
    
    <p>जब तुम किसी की बुराई करते हो, उसके बुरे कर्मफलों के भागीदार बनते हो ।</p>
    
    <p>इसे जानो, और अपने अच्छे और बुरे, दोनों ही कर्मों को ईश्वर को समर्पित कर, स्वयं मुक्त हो जाओ ।</p>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>ONLY SPEAK KNOWLEDGE</B></P>
<P>Only speak Knowledge. Don't repeat anything that someone tells you or opinions about anyone that someone states -- "That so-and-so said such-and-such about you." If someone comes to tell you such things, discourage them. Don't believe it. </P>
<P>If someone blames you directly, know that they are taking away your bad karma and let it go. Don't believe in it, and if you're one of the Guru's close ones, you will take all of the blame of the world with a smile. </P>
<P>Conflict is the nature of the world; comfort is the nature of the self. Amidst the conflict seek the comfort. </P>
<P>When you are bored with the comfort, get into the games of the world. When you are tired of the games of the world, get into the comforts of the Self. If you are one of the Guru's close ones, you do both simultaneously. Trying to end conflict prolongs it. Face the conflict by seeking the comfort of the Self. </P>
<P>God is alive in the world and has been putting up with all the ongoing conflicts throughout the ages. If God can put up with all the conflicts, you can too. The moment you agree to be with the conflict, the conflict disappears.</P>
<P>People who love peace do not want to fight, and those who fight do not love peace. Those who want peace want to run away. What is needed here is to be peaceful within and then fight. The whole message of the Gita is to be peaceful yourself and then fight. Krishna tells Arjuna to fight but be in peace at the same time. Does this ring a bell?</P>
<P>In the world, you resolve one conflict and another one comes up. For example, Russia is solved and then Bosnia arises. You make one better, and then another starts up. Your body gets a cold, then you get better; then your back hurts, then it gets better. Your body gets better, and then the mind goes. The world runs like this, isn't it?</P>
<P>Without any intention, misunderstandings happen. It's not up to you to try to resolve them. Ignore them and be alive.</P>

      <p>जब शांति से मन ऊबने लगे, सांसारिक क्रीड़ाओं से जुड़ जाओ। फिर जब इनसे थक जाओ, आत्मा कि शांति में आ जाओ। यदि तुम गुरु के करीब हो, तो दोनों साथ साथ करोगे।द्वन्द समाप्त करने कि चेष्टा द्वन्द को और बढ़ाती है।आत्मा कि शरण में आकर विरोध के साथ रहो। ईश्वर व्यापक है और अनंत काल से ईश्वर सभी विरोधों को सँभालते आये है । यदि ईश्वर सभी विरोधों को ले सकते है, तो तुम भी ऐसा कर सकते हो । जैसे ही तुम विरोध के साथ रहना स्वीकार कर लेते हो, विरोध समाप्त हो जाता है।</p>
      
      <p>शांति चाहने वाले लोग लड़ना नहीं चाहते और लड़ने वालों के पास शांति है नहीं । शांति चाहने वाले लड़ाई से भाग जाना चाहते हैं । आवश्यक हैं मन से शांत होकर, फिर लड़ना ।आत्मा के सुकून में रहते द्वन्द का सामना करो। गीता की यही मूल शिक्षा है कि शांत मन से युद्ध करो । कृष्णा अर्जुन को हृदय शांत रख कर युद्ध कि सलाह देते हैं।</p>
      
      <p>संसार में जैसे ही  तुम एक विरोध समाप्त करते हो, दूसरा खड़ा हो जाता है। जैसे ही रूस की समस्या समाप्त हुई,बोस्निया की समस्या कड़ी हो गई। एक समस्या हल होती है , दूसरी खड़ी हो जाती है । जैसे ही जुकाम से छुटकारा मिला, पीठ का दर्द शुरू हो गया। जब शरीर स्वस्थ हो जाता है, मन की बीमारी शुरू हो जाती है। संसार ऐसे ही चलता है, है न ?</p>
      
      <p>न चाहने  पर भी कभी कभी गलत फहमी हो जाती है। इनको सुलझाना तुम्हारा काम नहीं है। इन सब में मत उलझो और अपना जीवन जीओ ।</p>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>MASTER IS A DOORWAY</B></P>
      <P>Master is a doorway. And the doorway needs to be more charming than the world so that you will come to the doorway. Someone is in the street and there is rain, thunder, hot sun; they need shelter. They look around, they find a doorway. They come to the doorway. The doorway is more inviting, more charming, more celebrative, more joyful than anything else in the world.</P>
      <P>Nothing could give that much peace, joy, pleasure in the world. Once you come to the doorway, you enter the door and see the world from there. See the world from the eyes of the Master. This is a sign that you have come to the Master. Otherwise you may still be standing in the street and looking at the door. </P>
      <P>But once you have entered the door, then you will see the whole world from the eyes of the Master. This means what? In every situation that you face, you will think, "If this situation comes in front of the Master, how would he handle it?" or "How would she handle it?" "If this complication comes in front of the Master, how would he take it?" "If someone blames the Master like this, how would he handle it?" See the world from the eyes of the Master all the time.</P>
      <P>The world looks much more beautiful; not a nasty place. But a place filled with love, filled with joy, cooperation, compassion, and all virtues. The world is much more fun. Looking through the doorway, there is no fear. You will look at the world without any fear. You will be in all relationships with everybody without any fear. Because there is shelter. </P>
      <P>From inside home, you will look at the thunder, you will look at the storm, you will look at the rain, you will look at the bright sun. Inside you have air conditioning. Very cool, pleasant. Outside it's hot. You donÒ´ mind because there is nothing that can really distract you, disturb you, or take the fullness away from you. Such a sense of security, such a sense of fullness and joy comes. That is the purpose of having a Master.</P>
      <P>All relationships in the world go topsy-turvy. You make relationships and you break relationships. All relationships can get broken or made up and again broken. And there is craving and aversion. This is the world. This is samsara.</P>
      <P>But the Master is not a relationship. The Master is the Presence. What is necessary is to feel the Presence of the Master, not to make a relationship. Don't make the Master a part of your world. Then the same, "Oh, he looked at me." "He didn't look at me." "Oh, he said this." "He didn't say that." "Oh, somebody is close. I am not close." All this garbage comes into it. You feel the Presence of the Master, that is eternal. That has been there with you before, now, and will be there in the future, too.</P>
      <P>Master is the Presence. World is relativity. And relativity has limitations. Presence is unlimited. Presence is vast, infinite, and all comprehensive, all inclusive. And the presence of the Master in one's life will bring fulfillment to all relations. Every relationship will become complete with the presence of the Infinity if the Master is in your life. </P>

        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        <p>गुरु प्रवेश द्वार हैं। और यह प्रवेश द्वार बहार की दुनिया से अधिक आकर्षक होना ही चाहिए ताकि तुम द्वार पर आओ। तुम बहार पथ पर खड़े हो जहाँ वर्षा, बिजली और कड़ी धूप का प्रकोप हैं । तुम्हें कही आश्रय चाहिए। पर तुम चारों ओर देखते हो और तुम्हें प्रवेश द्वार नज़र आता हैं। तुम द्वार पर आते हो क्योंकि यह द्वार संसार की किसी भी वस्तु से अधिक आकर्षक, उत्सवपूर्ण  व आनंदमय हैं ।</p>

<p>गुरु के द्वार में प्रवेश करते ही तुम अपने आवास में आ जाते हो</p>
<p>तुम दुनिया को एक नये दृष्टिकोण से देखते हो</p>

<p>अंदर बैठे गर्जन सुनायी दे रही हैं, बारिश दिखायी दे रही हैं, पर अब यह सब तुम्हें विचलित नहीं करता</p>
<p>अंदर सुख और सुरक्षा हैं, अब दुनिया और सुन्दर लगती हैं</p>
<p>भयानक होने की बजाये प्रेम, सहयोग और संवेदनशीलता से भरपूर</p>
<p>तुम्हारा भये छूट जाता है।</p>

<p>जब तुम सारी सृष्टि गुरु की दृष्टि से देख सकते हो, तो यह संकेत है कि तुम गुरु के पास आ गये हो, तुमने द्वार में प्रवेश कर लिया है । गुरु होने का यही उद्देश्य है ।</p>

<p>यदि तुम दुनिया को अब भी पुराने दृष्टिकोण से देख रहे हो , तो तुम गुरु के पास अभी नहीं आये हो , तुम अब भी बहार सड़क पर खड़े हो, ठण्ड और बारिश में । तुम केवल द्वार देख रहे हो , उसमें प्रवेश नहीं किया ।</p>

<p>" गुरु की दृष्टि से देखने" का क्या अर्थ है ? केवल यही: हर परिस्थिति में तुम यही सोच रहे हो - यदि यह परिस्थिति गुरु के सामने आये, तो वे क्या करेंगे ? यदि यह समस्या गुरु के पास आये, तो वे उसका समाधान कैसे करेंगे ?</p>
<p>मूल बात है गुरु की उपस्थिति को महसूस करना । गुरु वह उपस्थिती है, कोई संबंध नहीं</p>

<p>संबंध टूट सकते है, जुड़ सकते है , और फिर टूट सकते है । हर संबंध में राग द्वेष है । यही संसार का चक्र है, इस दुनिया का क्लेश । सभी संबंद उलट पुलट हो जाते है, जबकि उपस्थिती विशाल, अनंत , अटल एवं केंद्रित है ।</p>

<p>गुरु को एक सांसारिक संबंध न बनाओ । "अरे , उन्होंने मुझे देखा ।"  "उन्होंने मुझे नहीं देखा ।"  " अरे , उन्होंने यह कहा।" " यह नहीं कहा।" " कोई और उनके निकट है , मै नहीं हूँ ।" यह सब निरर्थक बातें आ जाती है ।</p>
<p>बस गुरु के द्वार में प्रवेश करो और अपने आवास में आ जाओ । केवल गुरु की उपस्थिती ही तुम्हारे जीवन में , और तुम्हारे सभी संबंधो में सम्पूर्णता लाएगी</p>

Accepting it either as black or as white. Put it either as black and accept it or as white and accept it -- whether or not it is black or white. And see the gray as a shade of black or white. Either way you accept it. Honest or dishonest -- accept it. Then the mind is quiet. You are not in the gray area.</P>
      <P>See, the eyes are dark, eyebrows are dark, the thymus -- the most powerful organ of the body -- is black. Hemoglobin -- the main force of the body -- is black. You cannot survive without black. It is part of you.</P>
      <P>Or see it as white. Eye is also white. Bones are white; the structure on which the whole body stands is white. Put it in a category of black -- no problem -- accept. Put it in a category of white -- no problem -- doubt is not there. Have conviction. "I accept. They are dishonest and still part of me." That's it. Finished.</P>

          <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>शंका</B></P>
          <P>&nbsp;</P>
          <p>शंका जीवन का वह अंश है जिसमे भूरापन है, जो ना तो सफ़ेद है ना काला।</p>

          <p>फिर शंका का समाधान कैसे करें ?</p>
          <p>जिस बात पर शंका है उसे काला या सफ़ेद मानकर स्वीकार कर लो । अपनी शंका को सफ़ेद  देखो , कोई शंका नहीं बचती । या उसे काला देखो और स्वीकार कर लो । दोनों में किसी भी तरीके से, उसे स्वीकार करो और आगे बढ़ो । किसी को ईमानदार या फिर बेईमान मानकर स्वीकार करो । तब तुम्हारा मन शांत रहता है । तब तुम शंका के भूरेपन में नहीं हो । ढ्रंढ विशवास रखो: " वह बेईमान है पर फिर भी मेरा ही अंश है । वह जैसा भी है, मै उसे स्वीकार करता हूँ । " बस । ख़तम ।</p>
          
          <p>शंका ऐसी डाँवाडोल अवस्था है जिसमें पैर ना इस किनारे है, ना उस किनारे ।</p>
          
          <p>वहाँ से तनाव शुरू होता हैं। कोई एक दिशा चुनो और फिर से अपने पैर जमा लो। कभी ध्यान दिया है कि तुम केवल अपने जीवन की सकारात्मक चीजों पर ही शंका  करते हो ? नकारात्मक चीजों पर शंका नहीं करते।  तुम किसी कि ईमानदारी पर शंका करते हो और उसकी बेईमानी पर विशवास। जब कोई तुमसे नाराज़ होता है तो उसकी नाराज़गी पर तुम्हें कोई शंका नहीं होती। पर जब कोई कहे कि वे तुमसे प्रेम करते हैं, शंका आ जाती है: " क्या सच में वे मुझसे प्रेम करते हैं ।" जब तुम दुखी होते हो तो क्या कभी सोचते हो " क्या मै सच में  दुखी हूँ ?" नहीं ! तुम अपने दुःख को सत्य मान लेते हो। पर जब तुम प्रसन्न होते हो तो शंका करते हो " क्या मैं सच में प्रसन्न हूँ ? क्या मैं वास्तव में यही चाहता था ?" तुम अपने सामर्थ्य पर शंका करते हो, पर क्या कभी अपने असामर्थ्य पर शंका करते हो ?</p>
          <p>सकारात्मक चीजों पर शंका करने की इस धारणा को देखो ।</p>
          
          <p>शंका को उसके उचित स्थान पर रखो और शंकाओ पर शंका करो ।</p>
          <p>नकारात्मक पर शंका करो और अपनी श्रद्धा सकारात्मक में रखो ।</p>

        <P>&nbsp;Celebration happens around the bonfire. Grief happens around the fire of cremation. The same fire that supports life in winter, can also destroy. One fire, like a ghee lamp, lights your way and purifies. Another fire made of toxic material creates pollution. </P>
        <P>&nbsp;You are also like fire. Are you the fire that creates smoke and pollution or the flame of camphor which creates light and fragrance? A saint is like a camphor flame that creates light and the fragrance of love. He is the friend of life.</P>
        <P>&nbsp;The fire that creates light and warmth and is useful is of higher quality. The fire that creates light and a little smoke as well is of medium quality. The fire that creates darkness and only smoke is of low quality. Learn to distinguish the different fires. If your senses are engaged in goodness, then you will create light and fragrance. If engaged in impurity, you create smoke and darkness. It is <I>samyama</I> that transforms the quality of fire in you. Next week we will discuss <I>samyama</I>. </P>

        <p>इन्द्रियाँ अग्नि की तरह हैं । तुम्हारा जीवन भी अग्नि के  समान है । इन्द्रियों की अग्नि में जो कुछ भी डालते हो, जल जाता हैं। यदि तुम टायर जलाते हो तो दुर्गन्ध निकलती है और वातावरण दूषित हो जाता है । पर अगर चन्दन की लकड़ी जलाते हो तो चारों ओर सुगंध फैलती हैं ।</p>

<p>अग्नि के चारों ओर बैठकर मंगल कार्य भी होते हैं और चिता की अग्नि दुःख का कारण होती हैं । जो अग्नि शीतल में जीवन को सहारा देती है , वही अग्नि विनाश भी कर सकती है । एक अग्नि घी के दीपाक की तरह रास्ता दिखती है और शुद्ध करती है । विषैले पदार्थो की अग्नि वातावरण को दूषित करती है ।</p>

<p>तुम भी अग्नि की तरह हो । क्या तुम वह अग्नि हो जो वातावरण को धुएँ से दूषित करती है या कपूर की वह लौ हो जो प्रकाश फैलाती है?</p>
<p>एक सन्त कपूर की लौ के समान है जो जीवन को प्रकाशमय और प्रेम से सुगन्धित करते हैं । वे सभी जीवों के मित्र हैं ।</p>

<p>जो अग्नि प्रकाश फैलाती हैं,  उष्णता प्रदान करती हैं , जो जीवन के लिए उपयोगी हैं , वह उच्च श्रेणी की हैं । जो अग्नि प्रकाश के साथ थोड़ा धुआँ भी फैलाती हैं , वह माध्यम श्रेणी की हैं । निम्न श्रेणी की अग्नि सिर्फ धुआँ और अंधकार फैलाती हैं । विभिन्न प्रकृति की अग्नि को पहचानना सीखो ।</p>
<p>जब तुम्हारी इन्द्रियाँ भलाई में लगी हो , तुम प्रकाश और सुगंध फैलाओगे । यदि बुराई में लगी हों , तुम धुआँ और अंधकार फैलाओगे ।</p>

<p>'संयम' तुम्हारे अंदर की अग्नि की प्रकृति को बदलता हैं । अगले सप्ताह हम 'संयम' पर बातें करेंगे ।</p>

          </B><P>&nbsp;How to get rid of <I>vasanas</I> (impressions)? This is a question for all those who want to come out of habits. </P>
          <P>&nbsp;You want to get rid of habits because they give pain and restrict you. The nature of <I>vasana</I> is to bother you, or bind you, and wanting to be free is the nature of life. Life wants to be free and when a soul doesn't know how to be free, it wanders through lifetimes wanting freedom.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;The way to come out of habits is vows. This is <I>samyama</I>. Everybody is endowed with a little <I>samyama</I>. </P>
          <P>&nbsp;A vow should be time bound. This would bring good conduct and save you from being wayward. Consider the time and place for vows to be taken.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;When the mind dwells on useless thoughts, then two things happen. One is that all those old patterns come up and you feel discouraged by them. You blame yourself and feel that you have not made any progress. </P>
          <P>&nbsp;The second thing is that you see it as an opportunity for <I>samyama</I> and feel happy about it. Without <I>samyama,</I> life will not be happy and diseases arise. For example, you know you should not eat three servings of ice cream, or eat ice cream every day, or otherwise you will get sick.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;Habits will clog you when there is no liveliness or juice in life. When there is a direction for life force, you can rise above habits through <I>samyama.</P>
          </I><P>&nbsp;Take vows according to time and place. For example, suppose someone has a habit of smoking cigarettes and says, "I will quit smoking," but cannot do it. They can take a vow, three months or 90 days; a time-bound vow. If someone is used to cursing and swearing, take a vow not to use bad language for ten days. Don't take it for a lifetime; you will break it immediately. If you happen to break it in between, don't worry. Just begin again. Slowly increase the duration until it becomes your nature.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;All those habits which bother you, bind them in vows, in <I>samyama</I>. So all those who are in Satsang, take a time-bound vow today and make a note of it. If you break a vow, make a note of it and share the time and date at the next Satsang. Continue it again. Tie those habits which bring you pain in <I>samyama</I>.</P>

              <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>आदत और संकल्प</B></P>
              <P>&nbsp;</P>
              <p>वासनाओ से कैसे मुक्त हों ?</p>
              <p>यह प्रश्न उन सब के लिए है जो आदतों से छुटकारा पाना चाहते हैं।</p>
              <p>तुम आदतों को छोड़ना चाहते हों क्योंकि उनसे तुम्हें कष्ट होता है, वे तुम्हें सीमित करती हैं। वासनाओ का स्वभाव है तुम्हें विचलित करना, तुम्हें बाँध देना; और जीवन का स्वभाव है मुक्त होने की चाह ।</p>
              
              <p>जीवन मुक्त रहना चाहता है।  पर जब यह नहीं मालूम कि कैसे मुक्त हों, तब आत्मा जन्म जन्मान्तरों तक मुक्ति की खोज में भटकती रहती हैं ।</p>
              <p>आदतों से छुटकारा पाने का उपाए है संकल्प।</p>
              
              <p>समय और स्थान को ध्यान में रखकर संकल्प करो। संकल्प समयबद्ध होना चाहिए । फिर तुम्हारा व्यवहार भी अच्छा होगा और तुम पथ से विचलित होने से बच जाओगे। इसलिए समय और स्थान का ध्यान रखते हुए संकल्प लो ।</p>
              
              <p>उदाहरण के लिए किसी को सिगरेट पीने कि आदत है और वह कहता है, "मैं सिगरेट पीना छोड़ दूँगा "। पर वह सफल नहीं होता। ऐसे लोग एक निर्धारित समय, जैसे तीन महीने या ९० दिनों के लिए संकल्प ले सकते हैं। अगर किसी को गाली देने की आदत है , वह दस दिनों तक बुरे शब्दों का प्रयोग नहीं करने का संकल्प करें । जीवन भर के लिए संकल्प मत करो क्योंकि तुम उसे निभा नहीं पाओगे । यदि कोई संकल्प बीच में टूट भी जाए, चिंता मत करो। फिर से शुरू करो । धीरे धीरे समय की सीमा बढ़ाते जाओ , जब तक वही तुम्हारा स्वभाव ना बन जाए ।</p>
              <p>यही 'संयम' है । हर एक में कुछ संयम होता ही है ।</p>
              
              <p>जब मन पुरानी प्रवृत्तियों में उलझने लगे, तब दो बातें हो सकती हैं। पहली, तुम्हारी पुरानी  आदतें वापस आ जाती हैं और तुम निरुत्साहित हो जाते हो। तुम अपने को दोषी ठहराते हो और सोचते हो की तुम्हारा कोई विकास नहीं हुआ।</p>
              
              <p>दूसरी ओर तुम इसे संयम अपनाने का एक नया अवसर मानकर प्रसन्न हो सकते हो। संयम के बिना जीवन कभी सुखी और रोग मुक्त नहीं हो सकता। उदाहरण के लिए, तुम्हें पता हैं कि एक साथ तीन आइसक्रीम या प्रतिदिन आइसक्रीम खाना उचित नहीं हैं। ऐसा किया तो बीमार पर जाओगे ।</p>
              
              <p>जब जीवन में उत्साह और रास का अभाव होता हैं, तब आदतें तुम्हें अवरुद्ध कर देती हैं। जब जीवन शक्ति को एक दिशा मिल जाती हैं तब संयम के द्वारा तुम आदतों के ऊपर उठ सकते हो।</p>
              
              <p>जो भी आदतें तुम्हें परेशान करती हैं, उन्हें संकल्प के द्वारा संयम में बाँध लो। इसलिए सत्संग में सभी लोग आज एक समय बद्ध संकल्प ले और उसे नोट कर ले। यदि संकल्प बीच में टूट जाए तो उसे भी नोट करें। उसकी समय और तिथि अगले सत्संग में सबको बताएं। फिर से उसी संकल्प को जारी रखें।</p>
              <p>जो आदतें तुम्हें कष्ट देती हैं, उन्हें संयम से बाँध लो।</p>

            </B><P>&nbsp;How to get rid of <I>vasanas</I> (impressions)? This is a question for all those who want to come out of habits. </P>
          </B><P>&nbsp;When someone blames you, what do you usually do? Blame them back or you put up resistance in yourself. When someone blames you, they actually take away some negative karma from you. If you understand this and don't put up resistance and feel happy about it, then you drop your resistance. "Oh, good. That person is blaming me. Good. Something is going away." And when you drop the resistance, your karma goes away. Do you see what I'm saying? </P>
          <P>&nbsp;So when someone blames you and you put up resistance in your mind, and you don't react, then you are not allowing them to take the negative karma. Outside you may resist, but inside if you don't resist, and feel happy, "Oh, good, somebody is there to blame me and take some negative karma," you will feel immediately lighter.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;How does it feel to you when someone blames you? Do you feel some heaviness? Usually, when someone blames you, you feel hurt and you feel unhappy, you feel sad. This is all because you're . . . resisting. That is it. What you resist, persists. The ignorant person tells someone, "Don't blame me because it hurts me."</P>
          <P>&nbsp;An enlightened person also says "Don't blame me." Do you know why? Because it might hurt you. This is a beautiful point. What are the points? You get hurt because you resist the blame. When someone blames you, you resist it inside. Outside you may not resist, but inside when you resist, then that hurts you.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;An ignorant person warns you, "You better not hurt me, you better not blame me because I will feel hurt." Someone warns you not to blame them because it will hurt them and they'll do something harmful to you out of revenge.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;An enlightened person says "Don't blame me because it will hurt you." So here you say, don't blame because of compassion. You can tell someone, don't blame me out of compassion, or you can say it out of anger.</P>

              <p>जब कोई तुम पर आरोप लगता हैं, साधारणतः तुम क्या करते हो? तुम भी उन पर आरोप लगाते हो या प्रतिरोध करते हो ।</p>

              <p>जब कोई तुम पर आरोप लगाता हैं, वह वास्तव में तुम्हारे कुछ बुरे कर्म ले लेता हैं। अगर तुम इसे समझ जाओगे तो दुःखी नहीं होंगे, प्रसन्न हो जाओगे।</p>
              
              <p>जब कोई तुम पर आरोप लगता हैं, चाहे तुम बाहर से प्रकट ना भी करो पर मन ही मन उसका विरोध करते हो, तब वास्तव में तुम उसे तुम्हारे बुरे कर्म लेने से रोकते हो। चाहो तो बाहर से प्रतिरोध कर सकते हो, लेकिन यदि मन से विरोध नहीं करते, तब तुम तुरंत हल्का महसूस करोगे। तुम प्रसन्नचित्त हो जाओगे- " चलो अच्छा हुआ, कोई तो है जो मुझ पर आरोप लगाकर मेरे बुरे कर्म ले रहा हैं।"</p>
              
              <p>जब कोई तुम पर दोष लगता है, तुम्हें कैसा अनुभव होता है? क्या बोझिल महसूस होता है? प्राय अपनी बुराई सुनकर मन को चोट पहुँचती है, मन दुःखी हो जाता है। ऐसा इसलिए होता है क्योंकि तुम..... प्रतिरोध कर रहे हो। बस!  जिस का  तुम विरोध करते हो वह और अटल हो जाता है।</p>
              <p>तुम दुःखी होते हो क्योंकि तुम आरोप का विरोध करते हो।</p>
              
              <p>अज्ञान व्यक्ति कहता है, " मुझ पर आरोप मत लगाओ क्योंकि मुझे दुःख होता है।" एक ज्ञानी व्यक्ति भी कहता है, " मुझ पर आरोप मत लगाओ।" जानते हो क्यों? क्योंकि शायद इससे तुम्हें चोट पहुँचेगी । वे सहनुभूति से ऐसा कहते हैं। तो तुम किसी को कह सकते हो कि वे तुम पर आरोप ना लगाएं, या तो सहनुभूति कि भावना से, या क्रोधित होकर।</p>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>TODAY IS KRISHNA'S BIRTHDAY</B></P>
    <P ALIGN="CENTER">&#9;&#9;BIRTH OF THE CENTER OF ATTRACTION</P>
  </B><P>&nbsp;Krishna means the most attractive . . . It is the divinity that is the most attractive; the energy that pulls everything to it. Krishna is the formless center which is everywhere. Any attraction from anywhere is coming only from Krishna. Often people fail to see the spirit behind the attraction and merely hold on to the outer shell. And the moment you try to possess the shell, you will see Krishna has played a trick and you will be left with an empty shell in your hands and tears in your eyes.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;Be clever like Radha -- don't be tricked by Krishna. Krishna could not escape from Radha, for her whole world was filled with Krishna. If you can see that wherever there is an attraction, there is Krishna; then you are Radha, you are in your center.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;The mind moves towards beauty, joy and truth. Krishna tells Arjuna, "I am the beauty in the Beautiful, the strength in the Strong, the wisdom in the Wise." In this way he arrests the mind from moving away from him.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;Krishna reveals this Knowledge to Arjuna because he is <I>Anasuya</I>. Next week we will see what is <I>Anasuya</I>.</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>श्री कृष्ण का जन्म दिवस: आकर्षण केंद्र का जन्म</B></P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <p>'कृष्ण', अर्थात सबसे अधिक आकर्षक- वह दिव्यता जो सबसे अधिक आकर्षक है, वह शक्ति जो सब कुछ अपनी ओर खींच लेती है। कृष्ण वह निराकार केंद्र हैं जो सर्वव्यापी हैं ।</p>

      <p>कोई भी आकर्षण, कही से भी हो, कृष्ण से ही है।</p>
      
      <p>प्राय मनुष्य आकर्षण के मूल सत्व को नहीं देख पाते और बाहरी आवरण में उलझे रहते है।</p>
      
      <p>जिस क्षण तुम बाहरी आवरण को प्राप्त करने की चेष्टा करते हो, कृष्ण तुम्हें चकमा देते है और तुम्हारे हाथो में रह जाता है खोखला आवरण और आँखों में आँसू।</p>
      
      <p>राधा की तरह चतुर बनो, कृष्ण के छल में मत आओ। कृष्ण राधा से दूर हो ही नहीं सके क्योंकि राधा की तो पूरी सृष्टि ही कृष्णमय थी। अगर तुम हर आकर्षण में कृष्ण को देख सको, तब तुम राधा हो , अपने आप में केंद्रित हो।</p>
      
      <p>मन सौंदर्य, आनंद व सत्य की ओर बढ़ता  है । कृष्ण अर्जुन से कहते है, "मैं सुन्दरता में सौंदर्य हूँ , सशक्त में शक्ति हु और ज्ञानी में ज्ञान हूँ।" इस प्रकार वे मन को अपने से दूर भटकने से रोक लेते है।</p>
      <p>कृष्ण अर्जुन को यह ज्ञान देते है क्योंकि अर्जुन 'अनसूया' है। अगले सप्ताह हम देखेंगे अनसूया क्या है ।</p>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>ANASUYA</B></P>
    </B><P>&nbsp;Knowledge will be different at different levels of consciousness. At a particular level of consciousness you will become <I>anasuya</I>. <I>Anasuya</I> is devoid of fault-finding eyes. If a mirror is dusty, you need a duster to clean it. But if your eyes have a cataract, any amount of dusting will not help. So first you have to remove the cataract. Then you can see that the mirror is already clean.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;There is a certain mind set that always finds fault, even in the best conditions in the world. When you give a person with this mind set the best, they still find faults. Even with the best possible companion, or the most beautiful painting, they will still find something wrong. That kind of mind set cannot know the sacred Knowledge. Krishna tells Arjuna that he is giving him the Royal Secret, because he is <I>anasuya</I>. "You are not finding fault in Me, even though you are so close."</P>
    <P>&nbsp;From a distance, even craters cannot be seen. Even on a smooth surface there will be holes. If you are only interested in the holes, you will not see the magnanimity of things. If you are not in <I>anasuya</I>, Knowledge cannot blossom in you. Then there is no point in giving Knowledge. </P>
    <P>&nbsp;Question: What about discrimination -- Wisdom?</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Answer: If it is in your vision, your vision will find discrimination. The moment you are out of the path, everything is all wrong, that is not <I>anasuya</I>. For example, you have a friendship, and after 10 years you decide to leave. When you leave, you do not see the good in that relationship. You find fault. This is not <I>anasuya</I>.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;However, once you discover you have the wrong vision, half of the wrong vision has already disappeared. There is a fine line here. There cannot be any better example than the cataract. Instead of saying, "My vision is blurred," you say, "The whole world is not sharp." Suppose someone is coming in. It is windy, so you shut the door. But the person thinks the door has been slammed in his face! This is <I>asuya</I>. It is not <I>anasuya</I>. Most of the population is like this.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;<I>Asuya</I> is finding fault. It is seeing malicious intent everywhere. It is like a child who says, "Mother, you don't love me!" The child's vision is wrong. If the mother does not love the child, who will? It is the same as if someone comes and says, "Guruji, you don't love me!" If I don't love them, forget about it. Nobody else in the world will! Where else will they find love? Nowhere. A mother may get frustrated but not a Master.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Question: It seems as though you can't have <I>anasuya</I> unless you are enlightened?</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Answer: Not always. This is an excuse. To get enlightenment, you must have this vision.</P>

        <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>अनसूया</B></P>
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        <p>कुछ लोगों के सोचने का ढंग ऐसा होता है की दुनिया की सबसे अच्छी परिस्थिति में भी उन्हें सिर्फ त्रुटियाँ ही नज़र आती है। ऐसे व्यक्ति को बढ़िया से बढ़िया दो, उसे फिर भी त्रुटियाँ ही नज़र आती है। अच्छे से अच्छा साथी हो, या सुन्दरतम चित्र, उन्हें केवल दोष दिखाई देता है। ऐसी विचारधारा को असूया कहते है और ऐसे व्यक्ति दिव्यज्ञान को जान ही नहीं सकते।</p>
        <p>असूया का अर्थ है दोष ढूँढना या सब जगह हानि पहुंचाने वाली मंशा देखना।</p>
        
        <p>जैसे कि तुम्हारी किसी से मित्रता है और दस वर्षों के पश्चात् कोई दोष देखकर तुम इसे तोडना चाहते हो  । जब तुम तोड़ते हो, तुम पुरे सम्बन्ध में कुछ भी अच्छा नहीं देखते, तुम त्रुटियाँ खोजते हो। यह असूया है।</p>
        <p>'असूया' मतलब दोष खोजना- सब जगह बुरा उद्देश ही देखना।यह उस बच्चे की तरह है जो अपनी माँ से कहता है, 'तुम मुझे प्यार नहीं करती हो'। बच्चे का यह सोचना गलत है। यदि माँ बच्चे को प्यार नहीं करती, तो और कोण करेगा?</p>
        
        <p>उसी प्रकार अगर कोई कहे, गुरूजी आप मुझे प्यार नहीं करते"- यदि मैं उसे प्यार नहीं करता, तो भूल जाओ। दुनिया में और कौन उसे प्यार करेगा? और कहाँ उन्हें प्रेम मिलेगा? एक माँ कुंठित हो कहती है पर एक गुरु नहीं।</p>
        <p>चेतना के अलग अलग स्तरों पर ज्ञान भी अलग होगा। चेतना के एक विशेष स्तर पर तुम अनसूया बन जाओगे।</p>
        <p>'अनसूया' अर्थात जो दोष नहीं खोजता।</p>
        
        <p>कृष्ण अर्जुन से कहते हैं कि वे उसको यह दिव्यज्ञान दे रहे हैं क्योंकि अर्जुन अनसूया है। "तुम मेरे इतने करीब होकर भी मुझ में कोई दोष नहीं देखते हो"।</p>
        
        <p>दूर से लोगों में दोष छिप जाते हैं पर पास आकर नहीं छिप सकते।</p>
        <p>दूर से तो कन्दर भी दिखाई नहीं देते। निकट से देखें तो समतल भूमि में गढ्ढ़े होते हैं। यदि तुम्हारा ध्यान केवल गढ्ढ़े पर ही है, तो दृश्य कि विशालता तुम्हे कभी नहीं दिखाई देगी। यदि तुम अनसूया नहीं हो, तो ज्ञान तुममें पनप नहीं सकता , तब ज्ञान देना निरर्थक है।</p>
        
        <p>अगर एक दर्पण पर धूल हो, उसे साफ़ करने के लिए झाड़ने की जरुरत होती है। पर यदि तुम्हारी आँखों में ही मोतियाबिंद हो, कितनी भी सफाई कर लो कोई लाभ नहीं। इसलिए पहले मोतियाबिंद निकालना है तब तुम देखोगे कि दर्पण तो साफ़ ही है।</p>
        <p>असूया - दोषारोपण तुम्हें यह धरना देता है" यह पूरी दुनिया ठीक नहीं है। किसी काम की नहीं है।"</p>
        
        <p>अनसूया है यह जानना " इस दुनिया को देखने वाली मेरी दृष्टि ही धुंधली है"। और जब अपनी गलत दृष्टि का आभास हो गया, तो आधी समस्या तो वहीं मिट गयी।</p>

      </B><P>&nbsp;The love of the ignorant can be harmful yet even the anger of the Enlightened is not harmful. It can be only good!</P>
      <P>&nbsp;An example is the school at the Art of Living Ashram in Bangalore. 250 children are enrolled but only 200 come to class on any given day. Fifty children don't show up. Why? They cry at home, "Mother, I don't want to go to school."</P>
      <P>&nbsp;The mother says, "Oh, la la, don't cry . . . ok." She thinks, "No child in the world is like my child." And so she sticks up for the child and begins to speak for him. She does not see the teacher's point of view. The mother asks the teacher, "Why are you not teaching my child properly? He is so innocent, so lovely." So, what happens -- the child grows up spoiled. The love in the mother's ignorance has spoiled the child. The child will never learn the alphabet, never learn to read or write, but the mother says, "Oh, never mind, there are sheep to look after and fields to tend." The mother's love in ignorance has spoiled the child.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;The anger of the Enlightened is a blessing. There are many instances of this in the <I>Puranas</I>. Once a Master was traveling in the middle province of India with a disciple following him a few yards behind. Some boys who were rude, rough, and abusive began to throw stones and tease the disciple calling him names. This went on for some time as the boys followed the Master and the disciple. They came to a river. The Master and the disciple got into a boat in order to cross. The boys got in another boat which started to sink in the middle of the river.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;The Master slapped the disciple across the face. The disciple was so surprised as he had not said a word back to the boys in response to their taunts. He had been such a good disciple and yet the Master had slapped him!</P>
      <P>&nbsp;The Master said, "It is your fault. You are responsible for their boat sinking. You did not respond to their abuse. Nature has now punished them in a worse way because you did not have enough compassion to quell their insults."</P>
      <P>&nbsp;The slap that the Master gave took away the karma of this event such that it would not be carried into the future of the boys. It also served to take away any little bit of joy the disciple may have felt at seeing the boys' boat sink! Thus, it also took away the karma of the event for the disciple. So, the anger of the Enlightened is a blessing!</P>

          <P>&nbsp;</P>
          <p>अज्ञानी का प्रेम हानिकारक हो सकता है परन्तु ज्ञानी का क्रोध हानिकारक नहीं है। वह केवल हितकर ही हो सकता है।</p>

          <p>अदाहरण के लिए हमारे बंगलौर आश्रम के विद्यालय में २५० बच्चें भर्ती है लेकिन प्राय  २०० बच्चे ही पढ़ने आते है। ५० बच्चे आते ही नहीं। जानते हो क्यों? वे घर पर रोकर कहते है," माँ ! मैं स्कूल नहीं जाना चाहता।"  माँ कहती है, "ठीक है बेटा, तू रो मत। " वह सोचती है कि  दुनिया का कोई भी बच्चा उसके बच्चे जैसा है ही नहीं। वह बच्चे का पक्ष लेकर बोलने लगती है, अध्यापक के दृष्टिकोण को नहीं देखती। तो क्या होता है ? बच्चा बिगड़ जाता है। बच्चे को कभी अक्षर का ज्ञान नहीं होगा, वह कभी पढ़ना-लिखना नहीं सीखेगा। फिर भी माँ कहती है, "कोई बात नहीं; भेड़ो को चराना  है, खेतों की देखभाल भी तो करनी है।" माँ का प्रेम, अज्ञानतावताश, बच्चे को बिगाड़ता है।</p>
          
          <p>दूसरी तरफ,</p>
          <p>ज्ञानी का क्रोध आशीर्वाद है।</p>
          <p>पुराणों में इस विषय पर अनेक उदाहरण है। एक बार एक गुरु भारत के मध्यभाग में कहीं यात्रा कर रहे थे। उनका एक शिष्य उनके पीछे चल रहा था। कुछ दुष्ट बच्चो ने शिष्य पर पत्थर फेंकना शुरू किया।वे उसे चिढ़ाने लगे और गाली देने लगे। वे गुरु और शिष्य के पीछे हो लिए और ऐसे ही कुछ समय तक चलता रहा।</p>
          <p>वे सब एक नदी के तट पर पहुँचे। नदी पार करने के लिए गुरु और शिष्य एक नव पर बैठे। बच्चे भी दूसरी नाव पर बैठ गए। बीच नदी में पहुचकर उनकी नाव डूबने लगी।</p>
          
          <p>गुरु ने शिष्य के गाल पर तमाचा लगाया। शिष्य चकित रह गया क्योंकि बच्चों के जवाब में उसने एक शब्द भी नहीं कहा था। वह समझ नहीं सका कि इतना अच्छा शिष्य होने पर भी गुरु ने उसे क्यों मारा?</p>
          <p>गुरु ने कहा, "यह सब तुम्हारा दोष है। उनकी नव डूबने के लिए तुम जिम्मेदार हो। तुमने उनके बुरे शब्दों का कोई उत्तर नहीं दिया। क्योंकि तुममें इतनी दया नहीं थी कि तुम उनके बूरे शब्दों को रोको, इसलिए प्रकृति ने अब उन्हें इतना कठोर दण्ड दिया है।"</p>
          
          <p>गुरु के तमाचे ने इस घटना के बुरे कर्मों से बच्चों के भावी जीवन को प्रभावित होने से बचा लिए। साथ ही बच्चों की नाव डूबते देखकर शिष्य के मन में आए आनन्द को दूर कर दिया। इस प्रकार शिष्य को भी इस घटना के कर्म से बचा लिया। अतः , ज्ञानी का क्रोध भी आशीर्वाद है।</p>

            <p>एक प्रिय व्यक्ति, जिस पर तुम्हें विश्वास है, तुमसे झूट कहता है और पकड़ा जाता है। तुम्हें क्या अनुभव होता है?</p>

            <p>कुछ ही दिन पहले, किसी ने मुझ से झूठ कहा। मुझे प्रसन्नता हुई और उसके प्रति अधिक प्रेम अनुभव हुआ क्योंकि वह सफल झूठा नहीं था। यदि वह सफल झूठा होता, तो वह पकड़ा ही नहीं जाता। मैंने सोचा कि वह इतना भोला है कि ठीक तरह से झूठ भी नहीं बोल सका। झूठ कहा और पकड़ा गया।यदि वह पकड़ा न जाता, तुम्हें कैसे पता चलता कि वह झूठा है?</p>
            <p>इसलिए , असली झूठे को तुम कभी भी नहीं जान सकते।</p>
            
            <p>किन्तु तुम उसी को झूठा कहते हो जो अपनी मासूमीयत के कारण अच्छी तरह झूठ नहीं बोल रहा है। ऐसा होता है कि नहीं ?</p>

  <P>&nbsp;Every atom of Big Mind is crammed with Knowledge. Knowing this, you stop seeking. You seek until you come to the Master. You walk until you come to the swimming pool. You don't walk or run in the swimming pool -- you swim or float. Once you come to the Master, seeking stops, blossoming begins.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;You are Knowledge. Every atom in you is shimmering with Knowledge. This is called <I>Go</I>. Be a <I>Go-Pal</I>. Be a friend in Knowledge.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;<I>Go</I> has four meanings:</P>

  <P>&#9;Movement</P>
  <P>&#9;Achievement</P>

  <P>&#9;Complaining</P>
  <P>&#9;Similar cravings or aversions</P>

<p>छोटे मन की विजय दुःखदाई है, विराट मन की विजय आनन्द है</p>

<p>'जय गुरुदेव' अर्थात तुममे जो महानता है, उसकी विजयः उस विराट मन की विजय जो विनोद प्रिय भी है और गंभीर भी।</p>

<p>'जय गुरुदेव' का अर्थ गुरु की जय नहीं है। तुम अपने विराट मन की विजय कहते हो, कुंठित छोटे मन पर अपनी आत्मा की जय , अपने विराट मन की विजय।</p>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>FREEDOM AND DISCIPLINE</B></P>
  </B><P>Freedom and discipline are opposites and complementary. The purpose of defense is to protect freedom. But is there freedom in defense? Do soldiers have freedom? No, they are totally bound, not even allowed to put the right foot down when told the left foot. Their steps are measured and they are unable even to walk with a natural rhythm. There is total lack of freedom in defense. That which has absolutely no freedom is protecting the freedom of the country! So it is with the police; they protect the freedom of the individual. But are they free?</P>
  <P>Discipline protects freedom. They both go hand in hand. Understand this and go ahead in life. You have some restrictions and it is this that allows you freedom. You can choose to focus either on freedom or discipline, and this makes you happy or unhappy. Freedom without discipline is like a country without a defense.</P>
  <P>Fences should be fences; a fence cannot be built all over the property. If your fence is all over, how can you build on the property? That state of high absolute freedom is too difficult; we need to be very practical. Yes, there is a state of unlimited bliss, the freedom Advaita talks about. The Advaita Knowledge has been totally misused or used according to one's own fancies and conveniences.</P>
  <P>There must be awareness in the mind, love in the heart, and righteousness in action.</P>
  <P>Love and fear are two possibilities that put you on track. The Jewish religion put fear as the main thing so that life could improve. Nature induces fear at a certain age in a child. When a child is very young, it gets 100 percent time and love of the mother. The child has no fear. As the child grows more independent it becomes cautious. Nature brings in an iota of fear. With freedom, the child starts walking carefully. Fear of losing freedom also brings defense. The purpose of defense is to eliminate fear.</P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>On this path Knowledge is your Freedom<BR>and also your Defense.</B></P>

      <p>स्वाधीनता और अनुशासन एक दूसरे के विपरीत हैं और पूरक भी।</p>
      <p>रक्षा का उद्देश्य हैं स्वाधीनता का बचाव। पर क्या सुरक्षा में स्वाधीनता हैं?</p>
      <p>क्या सैनिक को स्वाधीनता हैं? नहीं! सभी सैनिक नियमों में बिलकुल बँधे हैं।</p>
      
      <p>उन्हें यदि बाया कदम उठाने का आदेश मिले तो वे दाहिना कदम नहीं उठा सकते।उनके कदम नपे- तुले होते हैं, यहाँ तक कि वे स्वाभाविक चाल भी नहीं चल सकते। इस 'रक्षा' में बिलकुल भी स्वाधीनता नहीं हैं। जिनको स्वयं बिलकुल भी आजादी नहीं, वे ही देश की स्वाधीनता की रक्षा करते हैं।</p>
      
      <p>अनुशासन-हीन स्वाधीनता सेना-विहीन राष्ट्र समान हैं। अनुशासन स्वाधीनता की रक्षा करता हैं। ये दोनों साथ-साथ चलते हैं। इसे समझो और जीवन में आगे बढ़ो। तुम्हें कुछ नियमों का पालन करना पड़ता हैं और यही संयम तुम्हें स्वाधीनता देता हैं। यह तुम पर निर्भर हैं कि तुम अपना ध्यान स्वाधीनता पर देते हो या अनुशासन पर, और यही तुम्हें सुखी या दुखी बनता हैं।</p>
      
      <p>चारदीवारी को अपने स्थान पर ही रहने दो, यदि सारी जमीन पर चारदीवारी बना डोगे , तो घर कहाँ बनेगा?</p>
      
      <p>लेकिन एक अच्छी चारदीवारी जमीन की रक्षा करती हैं।। प्रेम और भय दो सम्भावनाएं हैं जो तुम्हें सही रस्ते पर लती हैं। जीवन-उन्नति के लिए धर्मो ने भय को विशेष स्थान दिया हैं।</p>
      
      <p>शिशु के जीवन में एक विशेष समय पर प्रकृति भय की भावना को जगाती हैं। बच्चा जब बिलकुल छोटा होता हैं, उसे माँ का शत-प्रतिशत समय और प्रेम मिलता हैं। तब शिशु के मन में भय नहीं होता। जैसे-जैसे बच्चा बड़ा होता है, और आत्मनिर्भर होता हैं, तब सावधान हो जाता हैं। प्रकृति उस समय उसके मन में भय की भावना जगा देती हैं , आजादी के साथ बच्चा अपने कदम सावधानी से बढ़ाता हैं।</p>
      <p>एक परम आनन्द की, पूर्ण स्वतंत्रता की अवस्था हैं, जिसका वर्णन अद्वैतवाद में है। लेकिन अद्वैत ज्ञान का बड़ा दुरूपयोग हुआ है। लोगो ने अपनी सुविधा और गलत धारणाओं के आधार पर इसकी व्याख्या की है। मन में सजगता, हृदय में प्रेम और कर्मो में पवित्रता होनी चाइए।</p>
      <p>स्वाधीनता खोने का भय प्रतिरक्षा को जन्म देता है। प्रतिरक्षा का उद्देश्य है भय को दूर करना।</p>
      
      <p><b>इस पथ पर ज्ञान ही तुम्हारी स्वाधीनता है- और तुम्हारा रक्षक भी।</b></p>

      <P>&nbsp;</P>
    <p>ज्ञान की एक सीमा होती है, एक समाप्ति । शिष्यता की भी एक सीमा होती है क्योंकि शिष्य का ध्येय है ज्ञान-प्राप्ति।</p>

<p>नदी पार करने के बाद नाव से उतरना ही पड़ता है, चाहे नाव कितनी भी सुन्दर क्यों न हो। बारह वर्ष के बाद शिक्षा समाप्त होती है। गुरु तब 'समावर्त' उत्सव करते हैं और शिष्य को बताते है कि उसकी शिष्यता समाप्त हुई। अब वह गुरु से सम- व्यवहार करे और ब्रह्म की दिव्यता की निर्बाध अभिव्यक्ति होने दे।</p>

<p>'सखा' जीवन और मृत्यु का साथी है- यह कभी साथ नहीं छोड़ता। सखा को केवल प्रियतम चाहिए। उसे ज्ञान या मुक्ति की परवाह नहीं। उत्कंठा, तृष्णा के कारन प्रेम अधूरा है। उसका प्रेम असीम है और अनन्तता में कभी पूर्णता सम्भव नहीं। उसका प्रेम अनन्त अपूर्णता में पूर्ण है। प्रेम के पथ का कोई अन्त नहीं।</p>

<p>अर्जुन कृष्ण के सखा थे। कृष्ण परम-गुरु होने के साथ-साथ सखा भी थे।</p>
<p>आप क्या है?</p>
<p>शिष्य या सखा ?</p>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>SAKHA -- YOUR RELIABLE SENSE</B></P>
    
  <P>&nbsp;There are three things: the Self, the senses, and the object, or the world. And there are three words: <I>sukha</I>, pleasure; <I>dukha</I>, sorrow; and <I>sakha</I>, companion. These have one thing in common: "kha," which means "senses."</P>
  <P>&nbsp;The Self through the senses experiences the world. When the senses are with the Self, that is pleasure (<I>sukha</I>), because the Self is the source of all joy or pleasure. When the senses are away from the Self (<I>dukha</I>) -- in the mud, lost in the object -- that is misery. Mud, misery, mind -- they are very close.</P>
  </FONT><FONT FACE="BernhardMod BT" SIZE=5><P>Self &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senses ("Kha")&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; World</P>
  <P>---&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy (Sukha)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorrow (Dukha)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--- </P>
  </FONT><FONT FACE="BernhardMod BT"><P>Self is the nature of joy. In any pleasant experience, you close your eyes; you smell a nice flower, or you taste or touch something. So<I> sukha</I> is that which takes you to the Self. <I>Dukha</I> is that which takes you away from the Self. Sorrow simply means that you are caught up in the object, which goes on changing, instead of focussing on the Self.</P>
  <P>All the sense objects are just a diving board to take you back to the Self.</P>
  <I><P>Sa-kha</I>, companion, means: "He <B><I>is</B></I> the senses." <I>Sakha</I> is one who has become your senses, who is your senses. If you are my senses, it means I get Knowledge through you; you are my sixth sense. As I trust my mind, so I trust you. A friend could be just an object of the senses, but a <I>sakha</I> has become the very senses.</P>
  <P>The <I>sakha</I> is the companion who is there in both the experiences of the <I>dukha</I> and of <I>sukha</I>. It means one who leads you back to the Self. If you are stuck in an object, that wisdom which pulls you back to the Self is <I>sakha</I>.</P>
  <P>Knowledge is your companion and your companion is Knowledge. And the Master is nothing but the embodiment of Knowledge. So<I> sakha</I> means, "He is my senses, I see the world through that wisdom, through Him."</P>
  <P>If your sense is the Divine, then you see the whole world through the Divinity.</P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <p>तीन विषय है: आत्मा, इन्द्रियाँ एवं वस्तु (संसार) और तीन शब्द है: सुख, दुःख, और सखा।</p>

<p>इस तीनो ही शब्दों में एक समानता है- 'ख', जिसका अर्थ है इन्द्रियाँ।</p>
<p>आत्मा इन्द्रियों के द्वारा संसार का अनुभव करती है। जब इन्द्रियाँ आत्मा के साथ रहती है तब सुख होता हैं (क्योंकि आत्मा सुख और आनन्द का स्रोत है)</p>
<p>जब इन्द्रियाँ आत्मा से विमुख हो, भौतिक विषयों के दलदल में फ़स जाती है, तब दुःख होता है। यही दुःख है।</p>
<p>            संसार   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                               आत्मा </p>
<p>                                     इन्द्रियाँ ('ख')</p>
<p>            दुःख    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                                  सुख </p>
<p>आत्मा का स्वाभाव ही आनन्द हैं। सभी इन्द्रियाँ आत्मा की ओर उड़ान भरने के लिए हैं। किसी भी सुखद अनुभूति में तुम आँखे मूंद लेते हो- किसी सुगन्धित फूल को सूंघते हो तब या कोई स्वादिष्ट खाना चखते हो, अथवा किसी वस्तु को स्पर्श करते हो। सुख वह है जो आत्मा की ओर ले जाता है।</p>

<p>दुःख आत्मा से विमुख करता है। दुःख का यही अर्थ है कि, तुम आत्मा पर केंद्रित होने के बदले विषय- वस्तु में फंसे हो, जो परिवर्तनशील है।</p>
<p>'स-खा' शब्द का अर्थ है "वह ही इन्द्रियाँ है"। सखा वह है जो तुम्हारी इन्द्रियाँ ही है। अर्थात तुम्हारे माध्यम से मुझे ज्ञान मिलता है, तुम मेरी छठी इन्द्रिय हो। जिस प्रकार मैं अपने मन पर विश्वास करता हूँ, उसी तरह तुम पर भी विशवास करता हूँ। एक मित्र इन्द्रियों की अनुभूति का विषय हो सकता है परन्तु 'सखा' स्वयं इन्द्रिय बन जाता है।</p>

<p>'सखा' वह साथी है जो सुख और दुःख दोनों अनुभवों में साथ रहता है। अर्थात सखा वह है जो तुम्हें आत्मा की ओर वापस ले जाता है। जब तुम किसी विषय- भोग में फ़स जाते हो,तब जो ज्ञान तुम्हें आत्मा की ओर वापस लता है, वही सखा है।</p>
<p>ज्ञान तुम्हारा साथी है और तुम्हारा साथी ज्ञान है।</p>

<p>गुरु ज्ञान का प्रतिरूप है। 'सखा' का अर्थ है,"वह मेरी इन्द्रियाँ है, मैं संसार को उसी ज्ञान के द्वारा, उनके माध्यम से देखता हूँ।"</p>

<p>कुछ वर्षो में तुम्हारा मस्तक मिटटी में होगा, जीते जी अपना सर कीचड़ से मत भरो।</p>
<p>गुरु की दृष्टि से देखो तो पूरा विश्व दिव्य दिखेगा।</p>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>SCEPTICISM</B></P>
      
      <P>&nbsp;Ignorance is being a sceptic and not knowing you are a sceptic. If you think you are a sceptic, you are no longer a sceptic because you have a clue of something beyond. So, in reality, you can never know whether you are a sceptic or not!</P>
      <P>&nbsp;A sceptic is stuck in a paradigm and closes all other possibilities. But this creation is of all possibilities. As one understands the paradigm shift, scepticism is removed.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;A real scientist can never afford to be a sceptic because scepticism closes down possibilities and does not continue to probe into unknown areas of existence. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;In short, scepticism is an "I know it all" attitude, and this attitude is unscientific. Scepticism is dispelled by Knowledge. Perception and inference are two means of knowing.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;In every human being deep inside, there is faith and love. What you think is scepticism is only a thin layer. If you hold in your mind that they are sceptics you empower their scepticism. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;Do not recognize someone's scepticism and try to argue with them. Argument strengthens their scepticism. Fear of interference in one's freedom brings more resistance and causes scepticism.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;Your silence and the smile from your heart will dispel their scepticism. There is nothing better than silence to break scepticism. Silence means the quality of consciousness, not just keeping lips tight.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;Scepticism doesn't come up in children. It comes only with people who walk with boundaries. Children have no scepticism. They live in their fantasy world, a world of many possibilities. Their world is one of innocence, joy, beauty, and so much love.</P>

        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        <p>संशयवादी होकर भी यह नहीं जानना कि तुम संशयवादी हो, अज्ञान है। यदि तुम सोचते हो कि तुम संशयवादी हो, तब तुम संशयवादी नहीं रह जाते क्योंकि तुम्हें कुछ आभास है कि इसके परे भी कुछ है। इसलिए तुम वास्तव में कभी भी यह नहीं जान सकते कि तुम संशयवादी हो या नहीं।</p>

<p>संशयवादी एक भंवर में, एक विशेष सोच में फॅसा है और अन्य किसी सम्भावना को स्वीकार नहीं करता। लेकिन इस सृष्टि में अनंत सम्भावनाएं है। जैसे जैसे यह समझ आती है, सोचने के ढंग में परिवर्तन आ जाता है और संशय दूर होता है।</p>

<p>एक सच्चा वैज्ञानिक कभी संशयवादी हो ही नहीं सकता, क्योंकि </p>
<p>संशयवाद सृष्टि के अज्ञात छेत्रो की खोज जारी नहीं रहने देता।</p>

<p>संछेप में, संशयवादी की मनःस्थिति है, " मैं सब कुछ जानता हूँ"। और यह विचार-धारा अवैज्ञानिक है। संशय ज्ञान से दूर होता है।</p>

<p>प्रत्येक मनुष्य के अंतकरण में प्रेम और विश्वास है। जिसको तुम संशयवाद समझते हो, वह तो एक पतली सी परत है। यदि तुम निश्चय कर लेते हो कि कोई संशयवादी है, तुम उनके संशय को और मजबूत करते हो। किसी के संशय को मान्यता मत दो और उनके तर्क की कोशिश भी न करो। तर्क उनके संशय को और प्रबल कर देता है। स्वाधीनता में बाधा का भय उनके प्रतिरोध को बढ़ाता है, उनके संशय को और दर्जन करता है।</p>

<p>तुम्हारा मौन और तुम्हारी आंतरिक मुस्कान उनके संशय को दूर कर देगी। संशय को दूर करने के लिए मौन से बढ़कर कुछ भी नहीं। मौन का अर्थ सिर्फ होठों को बंद रखना नहीं है बल्कि यह तो चेतना का गुण है।</p>
<p>सीमित विचार-धारा के व्यक्तियों में ही संशय होता है।बच्चों के मन में संशय नहीं होता।बच्चे अपनी काल्पनिक दुनिया में रहते है,  ऐसी दुनिया जिसमे अनेक सम्भावनाएं है। उनका संसार सरलता , आनन्द, सौंदर्य और प्रेम से भरा है।</p>

        <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>SHAUCHA AND ASHAUCHA</B></P>
        
        <P>&nbsp;When you are miserable, what has happened is that you have gone away from the Self. This is called <I>Ashaucha</I>. It means you have become unclean.</P>
<P>&nbsp;In India when someone dies, the close relatives are said to be <I>Ashaucha</I> for 10 days because they are very sad. They are impure because they have moved away from the self. After 10 days of just being with that experience and reading the Gita, being with the Knowledge and pulling themselves back into the Self, then it is called <I>Shaucha</I>. They have purged out the impurities that have come during events.</P>
<P>&nbsp;This keeps happening again and again in dealings in life. You become <I>Ashaucha</I> and you have to get back to<I> Shaucha</I>. Go deeper in to yourself, then real <I>Shaucha</I> happens.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<I>Shaucha's</I> benefits are clarity in the intellect, a pleasing mind, focused awareness in the mind, a say over the senses, and therefore eligibility to realize the Self.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<I>Shaucha</I> is disinterestedness in the tendencies of one's own senses and non-association with other people. If a tendency in your body arises just have the understanding, "Oh yes, here is this old familiar tendency coming up again. Come on, you have had this experience enough, and still the body is craving for it again." Disinterestedness in one's own body -- just an idea, a sort of distaste, and in one moment it changes.</P>
<P>Why do people love each other so much, have such an intimate relationship, and then fight? <I>Ashaucha</I> has happened. If you don't get distaste for the tendency of the senses then distaste for the object of the senses will come and you will blame the object.</P>
<P>&nbsp;When <I>Ashaucha</I> happens then come back to <I>Shaucha</I> quickly. Suppose you get drowned in any worldly aspect, just know this is <I>Ashaucha</I> . . . "That is why I am suffering misery." Then come back to <I>Shaucha</I>.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Your attraction or craving is only as long as you think someone is "other." When you think they are part of you or your Self, then the attraction dies out. That is why a husband or wife is not attracted to the partner but to someone else because the partner has already become a part of them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;When you realize everyone is part of your Self, you enjoy the whole world without a sense of craving.</P>

          <P>&nbsp;</P>
          
          <p>जब तुम दुखी होते हो, वास्तव में क्या होता है? तुम अपनी आत्मा से विमुख होते हो, अपने केंद्र से विचलित। इसे अशौच कहते है। अर्थात, तुम अशुद्ध हो गये हो।</p>

          <p>जब किसी की मृत्यु हो जाती है, तब भारत में कहते है कि उसके सगे-संबंधी दस दिनों के लिए अशौच है, क्योंकि वे बहुत दुखी हैं। वे अपवित्र हो जाते हैं, क्योंकि वे अपनी आत्मा से विमुख हो गये है। दस दिनों तक केवल इस अनुभव के साथ रहकर, और गीता-पाठ कर, ज्ञान के संपर्क के फलस्वरूप फिर अपनी आत्मा के निकट पहुँच जाते है, तब उस अवस्था को शौच कहते है। घटनाओं से आई अशुद्धता से वे शुद्ध होकर निकल आते है।</p>
          
          <p>जीवन में यह बार-बार होता रहता है। तुम अशौच होते हो और तुम्हें फिर शौच होना ही है। अपने मन की गहराइयो में जाओ, तब सच्चा शौच होता है। शौच में हमको मिलती है बौद्धिक स्पष्टता, प्रसन्नचित्तता केंद्रित सजगता, इन्द्रियों पर काबू और,इन सब से, आत्मा-ज्ञान पाने की योग्यता।</p>
          
          <p>खुद की इन्द्रियों कि प्रवृत्तियों के प्रति अनिच्छा ही शौच है।तुम्हें ये समझ हो: " हाँ, फिर वही पुरानी प्रवृत्ति उठ रही है। अब छोड़ो , ऐसे अनुभव तो बहुत कर चुके, शरीर फिर भी उसी की लालसा कर रहा है "। अपने शरीर के प्रति उदासीनता-बस , एक ज़रा सा विचार, थोडी सी अरूचि और एक ही क्षण में स्थिति बदल जाती है ।</p>
          
          <p>लोग एक दूसरे को इतना प्यार करते है, इतना घनिष्ठ सम्बन्ध बनाते है , फिर क्यों लड़ते है? क्योंकि अशौच हुआ है। यदि इन्द्रियों की प्रवृत्तियों के प्रति तुम्हारी अरूचि नहीं होगी, तो इन्द्रियाँ जिससे आकर्षित है, उससे चिढ़ हो जाएगी और तुम उस वस्तु या व्यक्ति को दोष दोगे।</p>
          
          <p>कोई भी आकर्षण या आसक्ति तब तक है, जब तक तुम उसे पराया मानते हो। पर जब तुम सोचते हो कि वे तुम्हारे ही अंग है, तब वह आकर्षण समाप्त हो जाता है। यही कारण है कि पति-पत्नी एक दूसरे के प्रति उतना आकर्षित नहीं होते जितना दुसरो के प्रति, क्योंकि वे तो पहले से ही एक दूसरे के हो चुके है। जब तुम यह समझ जाते हो कि सभी तुम्हारी ही चेतना के अंश है, तब बिना किसी आसक्ति की भावना के तुम पूरी सृष्टि का आनन्द लेते हो।</p>
          
          <p>जब भी अशौच हो, जल्दी से वापस शौच में आ जाओ। मान लो तुम किसी भी सांसारिक विषय में डूब रहे हो, तो जान लो कि यह अशौच है.... " इसी लिए मैं दुखी हूँ।" फिर शौच में वापस आ जाओ। तुम्हारी साधना, ध्यान, सुदर्शन क्रिया, सेवा व सत्संग तुम्हारी सहायता करेंगे ।</p>

    <P>&nbsp;What is boredom? </P>
<P>&nbsp;A repetition without interest or love causes a monotonous state of mind; that is boredom. It overshadows the Self. </P>
<P>&nbsp;A practice or <I>abhyasa</I> is again a repetition whose purpose is to destroy the boredom and reunite with the Self. In this process the practice itself creates boredom and as you continue, it penetrates the boredom and destroys it once and for all. Whether the practice gives you joy or boredom, it must be continued. Only the practice or <I>abhyasa</I> can annihilate the Mind.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Self is Love and Love is always repetitive. That is why love letters are simply repetitive and there is no boredom there. If you are bored with yourself then how much more boring you would be for others. Root out the boredom in you through deep and continued meditation.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Wake up and Walk up.</P>

    <p>नीरसता क्या है ?</p>
    <p>बिना रूचि या प्रेम के किसी भी विषय को यदि बार-बार दोहराया जाये, तो मन उकता जाता है- यही नीरसता है, ऊब है। नीरसता की परत आत्मा को ढंक देती है।</p>
    
    <p>आध्यात्मिक क्रिया (साधना) को भी बार-बार दोहराते है, अभ्यास करते है जिसका उद्देश्य है इस नीरसता को दूर करना और फिर से आत्मा के साथ जुड़ जाना। अभ्यास अपने आप में नीरसता लाता है । परन्तु लगातार अभ्यास, नीरसता को पार कर उसे हमेशा के लिए समाप्त कर देता है। अभ्यास चाहे आनन्द दे या नीरसता, इसे जारी रखना है। केवल तुम्हारी क्रियाएँ, तुम्हारी साधना ही मन को वश में रख सकती है।</p>
    
    <p>आत्मा प्रेम है और प्रेम में हमेशा पुनरावृत्ति होती रहती है। यही कारण है कि प्रेम-पत्र में एक ही बात दोहराते रहने पर भी वहाँ नीरसता नहीं होती। यदि तुम अपने आप से ही ऊभ गये हो, तो तुम दूसरों के लिए कितने अधिक नीरस होंगे?</p>
    
    <p>निरंतर गहन ध्यान के द्वारा अपने मन कि नीरसता को जड़ से निकाल डालो। जागो और आगे बढ़ो।</p>

    <p>तीन शक्तियाँ है- ब्रह्म शक्ति, विष्णु शक्ति, शिव शक्ति। आप में कोई भी एक शक्ति अधिक प्रबल हो सकती है।</p>

<p> ब्रह्म शक्ति वह है जो नव- निर्माण करती है। विष्णु शक्ति पालन करती है और शिव शक्ति परिवर्तन लाती है- नया जीवन देकर या संहार कर। </p>

<p>कुछ लोगों में ब्रह्म शक्ति प्रबल है। वे नव- सृष्टि तो कर सकते है पर, हो सकता है उसे सुरक्षित  न रख सकें। उदाहरण के लिए, तुम नये मित्र बहुत जल्दी बना लेते हो, पर वह मित्रता अधिक समय तक नहीं रहती।</p>

<p>कुछ और लोग हैं जो नव- निर्माण नहीं कर सकते, पर जो कुछ भी है, उसे अच्छी तरह संभाल कर रख सकते है। उदाहरण के लिए, वे नये मित्र नहीं बना पाते, परन्तु पुरानी मित्रता बहुत अच्छी तरह निभाते है। इनमें विष्णु शक्ति प्रबल है।</p>

<p>फिर कुछ ऐसे भी व्यक्ति है जिनमें शिव शक्ति प्रबल  है। वे नव सृष्टि करते हैं। या परिवर्तन लाते  है- या फिर बनी-बनाई स्थिति का संहार कर सकते हैं।</p>
<p>गुरु शक्ति में ये तीनों शक्तियाँ पूर्ण रूप से प्रफुल्लित हैं।</p>

<p>इसलिए, तुम पहले यह पहचानो कि तुममें कौन सी शक्ति प्रबल है और गुरु शक्ति की आकाँक्षा करो, प्रार्थना करो।</p>
<p>गुरु एक संघ बनाता है पर एक संघ गुरु नहीं बना सकता।</p>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>HOW TO MAINTAIN INTIMACY</B></P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;Intimacy often gets broken because of ego or your desire. What breaks intimacy?</P>

    <DIR>
    
    <P>&#9;Ego or taking a position</P>
    <P>&#9;Desire</P>
    <P>&#9;Taking intimacy for granted</P>
    <P>&#9;Finding imperfection in oneself or others</P>
    <P>&#9;Expectations</P>
    <P>&#9;Insensitivity or over sensitivity</P>
    <P>&#9;Lack of vivek or vairagya (lack of discretion or dispassion)</P>
    <P>&#9;Judgements</P>
    <P>&#9;Grumbling or lack of gratitude</P></DIR>
    
    
    <P>Dissolving into infinity is the way to maintain intimacy. Intimacy is dissolving into infinity. Dissolving into infinity brings you to the moment. Go beyond events. Dissolve into infinity, be in the moment, and look beyond the events. This is the way to maintain intimacy.</P>
    <P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * </P>
    <P>If you attend Satsang you don't get much; but if you don't, you lose a lot. Just to maintain where you are, what you are, you need to attend weekly Satsang. </P>
    <P>&nbsp;Now, start doing ten minutes of Satsang, sharing of the Knowledge with someone, anyone. You are so used to talking gossip. Now for two weeks, talk Knowledge, especially to those not coming to Satsang. Even on the phone -- suppose you can't find someone at seven o'clock; call someone on the phone and talk Knowledge for a couple of minutes: "What are you doing? What do you want? How can I help you?" Praise the Divine.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;This is an exercise. Every day for ten minutes, do individual Satsang and skillfully talk ten minutes of Knowledge. Say, "Everything is temporary, everything is changing." Speak some Knowledge on the changing nature of the world.</P>

      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <p>घनिष्ठ सम्बन्ध अक्सर अहंकार या लालसाओं के कारण टूटते है । घनिष्ठता टूटने के क्या कारण है?</p>
<p>- अहंकार या हठ</p>
<p>-लालसा </p>
<p>-घनिष्ठता को मान्यता न देना </p>
<p>-अपने में,या दूसरों में, त्रुटियाँ देखना </p>
<p>-अपेक्षाएँ </p>
<p>-असंवेदनशीलता या अत्यधिक संवेदनशीलता </p>
<p>-विवेक और वैराग्य का आभाव</p>
<p>-निर्णयात्मक धारणा </p>
<p>-शिकायत या कृतज्ञता का अभाव </p>
<p> घनिष्ठता बनाइये रखने के लिए अनंत में मिल जाओ। अनन्त में डूब जाना ही घनिष्ठता है। अनन्त में मिल जाने से तुम वर्तमान क्षण में आ जाते हो। घटनाओं के ऊपर उठ जाओ।</p>

<p>  अनंत में डूब जाओ,</p>
<p>  वर्तमान क्षण में रहो,</p>
<p>  और घटनाओं के परे देखो।</p>
<p>  यही है घनिष्ठता बनाये रखना का उपाए।</p>

<p>   यदि तुम सत्संग में भाग लेते हो, तुम्हें बहुत कुछ नहीं मिलता। पर यदि नहीं भाग लेते हो, तो बहुत कुछ खोते हो। तुम जहाँ भी हो , जैसे भी हो, उसका बनाये रखने के लिए साप्ताहिक सत्संग बहुत आवश्यक है।</p>

<p>आज से, प्रत्येक दिन दस मिनट का सत्संग शुरू करो। किसी से ज्ञान की बातें करो , चाहे वह कोई भी हो। गप करने की आदत तो तुम्हें है ही। अब दो सप्ताह ज्ञान की बातें करो, विशेषकर उनसे जो सत्संग में नहीं आते है।</p>

<p>सबके लिए एक अभ्यास है- रोज़ दस मिनट अकेले सत्संग करो और कुशलतापूर्वक ज्ञान की बातें करो।</p>
<p>कहो,</p>

<p>"सब कुछ क्षणिक है , अस्थाई है;</p>
<p>सब कुछ परिवर्तनशील है।"</p>
<p>संसार कि परिवर्तनशील प्रकृति पर कुछ ज्ञान की बातें कहो।</p>

<P>&nbsp;This is exactly what happens in life. Many want sweetness in life. Some are searching hard, but only one finds it. And when that one finds it, he gives it to everyone.</P>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>OVERCOMING EVENTS</B></P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;All the problems that you face in life are because you attach over importance to the events. The events grow bigger while you remain smaller. Say, for example, you are riding a motorbike on a busy motor way and in front of you there is another vehicle emitting exhaust fumes. You have three options.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1. &#9;You can complain, somehow bear with it, and still follow the vehicle.</P>
<P>2. &#9;You can slow down or wait for some time to allow the vehicle to move far away from you.</P>
<P>3. &#9;You can use your skill, overtake the vehicle, and forget about it.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>As in the first case, most of you stick on the events and are miserable, like inhaling fumes throughout your journey.</P>
<P>In the second case, you don't get permanent relief, as another bigger vehicle might come in front of you. Like that, running away from events is not the permanent solution.</P>
<P>However, wise people use their skill and grow over the events. If the vehicle is in perfect condition, the skill is effective. Conditioning the vehicle is <I>sadhana</I> or practice. And skill is the grace of the Guru.</P>
<P>The mistakes that you have made in the past have made you humble; you need not make mistakes in the future to become humble.</P>

    <P>&nbsp;</P>
    <p>जीवन में सारी समस्याओं का सामना तुम्हें इसलिए करना पड़ता है कि तुम घटनाओं को अत्यधिक महत्व देते हो। घटनाएँ बड़ी बन जाती है और तुम छोटे रह जाते हो।</p>

    <p>उदाहरण के लिए मान लो की तुम एक व्यस्त सड़क पर मोटर- साईकिल चला रहे हो। तुम्हारे सामने एक गाड़ी है जो बहुत धुँआ छोड़ रही है । तुम्हारे पास तीन उपाए है:</p>
    
    <p>१. तुम शिकायत करते हुए, किसी तरह बर्दाश्त करते हुए, गाडी के पीछे चलते रह सकते हो।</p>
    
    <p>२. तुम अपनी गति को धीमा कर, या थोड़ा देर रुक कर, दूसरी गाड़ी को दूर आगे चले जाते दे सकते हो।</p>
    <p>३. तुम कुशलता-पूर्वक उस गाडी से आगे निकाल सकते हो और उस घटना को भूल जाते हो।</p>
    
    <p>            पहली सम्भावना की तरह जीवन में प्रायः हर व्यक्ति घटनाओं में फसकर दुखी होता है, जैसे कि रास्ते भर धुँआ झेलते रहना </p>
    <p>दूसरी सम्भावना  में भी तुम्हें पूर्ण राहत नहीं मिलती क्योंकि कोई दूसरी बड़ी गाड़ी तुम्हारे सामने आ सकती है। इस प्रकार घटनाओं से भागना स्थाई समाधान नहीं है।</p>
    
    <p>ज्ञानी अपनी कुशलता का प्रयोग कर, घटनाओं से आगे निकाल जाते है। कुशलता का प्रभाव तभी होता है जब वाहन की अवस्था उत्तम हो। वाहन की ऐसी अवस्था बनाये रखना ही साधना है, अभ्यास है। और कुशलता है गुरु की कृपा।</p>
    
    <p>पिछली गलतियाँ जो तुम कर चुके हो, उनसे तुम विनम्र बने हो। भविष्य में विनम्रता के लिए और गलती करने की आवश्यकता नहीं।</p>

</B><P>&nbsp;During Satsang, Guruji opened a small nicely-wrapped present. It was a tiny bottle of jasmine perfume. He twisted off the cap and sniffed the lovely fragrance. Then he proceeded to pour a small amount on some paper which he waved in the air, wafting the scent to all corners of the hall. Everyone could then enjoy it.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Guruji explained that it is not enough simply to have the fragrance. We have to know how to spread it. Flowers have the fragrance, but it is the wind that comes and spreads it. In the same way, each one of us is wonderful within -- we are beautiful, caring, and loving. But we do not know how to spread the fragrance.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Satsang is that wind which comes and spreads this fragrance to everyone.</P>

      </B><P>&nbsp;Guruji arrived for the first time on January 15th in the Croatian capital of Zagreb. As soon as we landed, Guruji was driven straight to one of the largest concert halls in Zagreb. Guruji first met with a group of over a hundred professionals including doctors and members of the press. A few hours later the hall was filled to capacity for his evening lecture. The national television station filmed the entire talk. Over 100 people waited outside unable to enter. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;Before addressing the large crowd Guruji went out to the lobby and greeted those who could not enter. His talk was exquisite and a soft feeling of grace and peace transformed the atmosphere. At the end of the lecture many still waited outside for over two hours to get a glimpse of Guruji.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;The next evening Guruji gave his first talk in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Hundreds crowded into the World Trade Center. Guruji was soon overloaded with flowers from the group. Guruji continued to talk for an hour and a half as the enthusiastic crowd would not let him finish. The atmosphere was charged with immense gratitude and celebration. The Art of Living groups in Croatia and Slovenia have done an excellent job.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;Guruji now flies off to New York for a television interview and then it's on to the advanced course in Hawaii!</P>

    <P>&nbsp;What type of time do you give the Divine? Usually you give the time that is leftover, when you have nothing else to do, when no guests are coming, there are no parties to go to, no nice movies to watch, no weddings to attend. Such time you give. This is not quality time. </P>
<P>&nbsp;Give quality time to the Divine. It will be rewarded. If your prayers are not answered it is because you have never given quality time. Give Satsang and meditation your highest priority. Give prime time to the Divine. You definitely will be rewarded.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * </P>
<P>&nbsp;Here in Hawaii there is a fun-filled course, for you know <I>God Loves Fun</I>. This has been followed with the long-awaited book, <I>Way of Grace</I>. Satsang is open to the public each evening. The huge waves of the Hawaiian shores cannot compete with the waves of bliss at Satsang. Guruji has brought out deep Knowledge from the most mundane questions. We are making efforts to bring these tapes to you soon.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * </P>
<P>What is most freely given yet not taken?</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1.&#9;Compliments? . . . no.</P>
<P>2.&#9;Blame? . . . no, people take blame.</P>
<P>3.&#9;Money? . . . no, money is readily taken, not freely given.</P>
<P>4.&#9;Happiness? . . . nobody can give happiness.</P>
<P>5. &#9;??</P></DIR>

<P>The clue is that it hangs in space like an orphan. No one owns it. Like an overripe papaya in Hawaii, it rots.</P>
<P>The answer to this riddle lies in the beginning.</P>
<P>ALOHA!</P>

  <P>&nbsp;There is a place you can come where everything is beautiful. Tourists go from place to place looking for beauty. They try to take beauty from that place. They only get tired and tanned. Yet the most beautiful spot anywhere is right here. When you come here, you find that wherever you are, everything is so beautiful.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Where is this place? Don't look here and there. Where do you go? Within you. When you come here, then any place is beautiful. Then wherever you go, you add beauty there.</P>
<P>&nbsp;If you are unhappy, even the moon is irritating to you. Sweet things are nauseating, music is disturbing. When you are calm and centered inside, noise is musical, clouds are magical, rain is liquid sunshine.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Book yourself on a trip to this most beautiful place in the universe. Then you find that every day is a vacation and a celebration.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

  		<P>&nbsp;<B>And now the NEWS splash from the surf</B>: </P>
<P>&nbsp;A lady was driving along the coast of Kauai and just started singing our Bhajans which she had never heard before. Later she found herself at our Satsang.</P>
<P>&nbsp;A Hawaiian Princess, Owana, found herself wondering why she felt compelled to drive in circles around a hotel in Honolulu. Later she found out from a devotee that it was Guruji's hotel. The next night she was singing her deeply felt native Hawaiian songs at Punditji's feet.</P>
<P>&nbsp;On Sunday, a lady named Mary was spending the day at an ancient temple ruins. She had gone there to make an offering and to pray. Her prayer was to meet her spiritual teacher and be shown the way Home. On Monday, she met Punditji and instantly became devoted. </P>

</B><P>&nbsp;Question: God is all abundant, all full and we are connected to God. Then why are we in debt, except for some? Why do they have, and we don't have?</P>
<P>&nbsp;Guruji: Is it only money? You have abundance, yet at the same time, you are indebted. So how can both be true? How can you be indebted and at the same time have abundance?</P>
<P>&nbsp;Somebody says: An abundance of indebtedness!</P>
<P>&nbsp;Guruji: When you say you are indebted, that means you have received. Otherwise how can you be indebted? So be thankful for being indebted, because you have received. Those who have received should feel indebted. If you don't feel indebted, you cannot have abundance. So the more indebted you feel, the more abundance you have.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Question: When the disciples met Jesus, they were not very successful, did not catch very many fish. When they met Jesus, he told them exactly where to fish and that's when they got lots of fish and then they decided to follow Jesus. </P>
<P>&nbsp;(Laughter)</P>
<P>&nbsp;Guruji: Feel indebted. Feel gratitude. Then abundance comes. As long as you are wanting for abundance you get indebted. Feel indebtedness and gratitude, then abundance comes.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Abundance and indebtedness coexist. You think you are indebted, but you really are not. It is better to feel totally indebted, because every bit of what you have, doesn't belong to you, including your body. Then you are infinitely indebted for your body, for Knowledge, for things you have received, and for your own life. Then you bask in the abundance of the Creator.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Someone says: I feel very indebted. Thank you!</P>

<P>&nbsp;Physicians of Apple Valley had organized memorable meetings and Satsangs. Guruji was on CNN News. Guruji was in the media and newspapers for several days before the much awaited event. Local TV stations were announcing the event every hour. </P>
<P>&nbsp;From there -- unbelievable Satsangs in packed halls in Los Angeles. The drummers and Divya got everyone on their feet. The atmosphere was electrifying. </P>
<P>&nbsp;Guruji went to the University of Northeast Missouri that had sponsored his visit. Students and Lloyd had organized 700 people to welcome Guruji.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Guruji, not only in spirit, but also physically, piloted a twin engine Cessna plane back to St. Louis, Missouri on his way to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The church was filled with devotion and decorations. The way Guruji looked -- the Grace and Knowledge were so magical -- the scene is impossible to describe. The hurricane of<I> Satva </I>has moved on to Miami. </P>

  		<P>&nbsp;<B>NEWS FLASH</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;Just a week before Guruji's arrival, Raj woke up in the middle of the night in Loughborough. He thought that some light was coming from the clock. He looked at Guruji's picture and saw that light was coming from it. This light grew and filled the room. He made sure that there was no outside light left on. The divine light stayed on for about ten minutes.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Upholland, Lancashire held an advanced course in Guruji's presence.</P>
<P>Guruji gave a talk on Ayurveda and the Art of Living at the Liverpool Medical Institution. The hall was full to capacity with standing room only, attended by medical professionals. It was a brilliant talk, but Punditji did not think so! He thought it was very mundane! There was great enthusiasm, however.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Next, Guruji's entourage moved with luggage and cars at its own speed and proceeded to Stourbridge in the Midlands for a talk organized by Stourbridge Earth Mysteries. The talk was simply great! The entourage then moved on to London, arriving at 3 o' clock in the morning for "The UK Tired of Living Teacher's Meeting" with baggage, blankets, pillows, plastic bags, pots and pans, and the usual divine chaos!!</P>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>KNOWLEDGE AND FAITH</B></P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;In science you have knowledge first, and then faith follows.</P>
<P>In spirituality, faith comes first, and then Knowledge follows.</P>
<P>For example, the knowledge that pesticides and chemical fertilizers are good for plants came through science, and people had faith in it, and all over the world they were used. And then another knowledge came that they were not good and the faith shifted to organic farming. The same with antibiotics. </P>
<P>The knowledge brought faith, the knowledge changed, and then faith changed. The knowledge and faith of science is of "happening." In spirituality, faith is first and Knowledge comes later. Like Kriya, Yoga, and meditation -- first you have faith and then Knowledge follows. For example, if you do pranayama faithfully then you get the Knowledge of the prana; if your do your meditation faithfully, the Knowledge of consciousness follows. Even an illiterate, through faith, attains deep Knowledge.</P>
<P>Vinod: Human is the best composite material. (Laughter -- this is the NASA scientist mind.)</P>
<P>Punditji: Science considers even human as matter, and spirituality considers even earth as mother, even rivers and mountains as living beings.</P>
<P>Science regards life as matter and spirituality regards even matter as life.</P> 		</font>

<P><I>Shivaratri</I> was celebrated in London as well as in the German Ashram. Devotees had put their hearts and souls to make the place so beautiful. The puja and Satsang transported everyone to another plane. As usual, laughter filled the corridors of the new Ashram. The big hall was already too small to the surprise of everyone! Our own spring water replaced Pepsi and Coke!</P>
<P>Then on to Copenhagen -- the capital of Denmark. It was a media event: people from TV, radio, and the newspaper were queuing into the hotel. The TV crew followed to the public talks which were packed and very lively.</P>
<P>Then the giggling gang moved on to Norway, but had left some luggage behind in the hotel. The flight was conveniently delayed, which was very unusual for SAS. Lakshmi had called Guruji the night before. Guruji had said we will arrive at the airport at exactly 12:15. It kept Lakshmi wondering and confused because it was almost one hour later than the original arrival time. And they all arrived on the dot at 12:15!</P>
<P>Wait for the exciting news from Norway and Sweden next week.</P>

      <P>&nbsp;Why do you respect someone? Because of their good qualities, isn't it? For example, positive qualities like honesty, wisdom, love, talents, behavior. But all these change in time. And when they do change, you lose respect. You only respect the greatness. </P>
<P>&nbsp;I have tremendous respect for each and every one. Not for their greatness or wisdom or talent, but for their very person. I respect everyone totally. So I can never lose respect for anybody, however they may be. One doesn't need to be great in order to be respected. Respecting the life makes you great. Don't look for respect from others; that makes you weak. Have respect for the self and no one can take your self-respect.</P>

It was -10 C and everyone was wearing heavy winter clothes, but there was Guruji, sledding with sandals and shawl. He didn't get a speck of snow on Himself.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Stockholm, Sweden: A TV crew was waiting in the meditation hall to interview him. They asked him what he thought about the New Age, if the Art of Living was part of the New Age. A moment of silence passed and with a vivid smile he replied, "Age is always new."</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Another programme entitled "The Three Wise Men" was made with one of Sweden's most respected TV journalists for a major TV channel. The three wise men included Guruji and the Dalai Lama.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Evening talks were filled with humor, brilliant questions were asked, and laughter filled the air. All the "hard nuts" started popping like popcorn. As usual, the best talks are never recorded.</P>

<P>Before Guruji arrived in Delhi, everything was meticulously planned and organized. When Guruji arrived, there was a spontaneous Satsang at the airport. Airport personnel and other passengers joined in. It was sparkling! The well-organized plans went haywire and the usual divine chaos followed. Everything was settled in a flash but the organizers were left holding the plans on paper!</P>
<P>There was an air of celebration at Saritha Vihar Satsang. The sweets and flowers made a carpet in the large hall that matched the fragrance of joy. At Karol Bagh, the next day, there was more than one reason for the authorities to raise their eyebrows -- stampede in the room, traffic jam on roads, and devotees forgetting their families in their eagerness to follow the "Gurumobile." Then on to Rishikesh and the teachers' refresher course. </P>
<P>Rishikesh. The lush green Himalayas all around -- in the front, the holy Ganges that roars, gurgles, and sometimes murmurs -- the sounds mingling with the chirping of the birds -- the call of the peacocks in the early morning -- the chiming of the temple bells at sunrise -- the chanting of Vedic hymns at all times. Dip in the cold waters -- everyone clad in shawls and sweaters on their way in -- and most reluctant to leave afterwards. Sitting with Guruji in the evening, watching the sunset. Electrifying Satsangs and discourses on Bhagwad Gita in Hindi by Guruji, transport everyone to a blissful, celestial experience. More about Rishikesh next week.</P>

<P>&nbsp;Guruji is still in Rishikesh. 350 people arrived from all over India for the advanced course -- a hundred more than expected. The volunteers had to run around trying to arrange rooms in the ashrams. During Satsang, the hall was spilling over with participants whose faces radiated ecstasy in the presence of the Master. </P>
<P>&nbsp;It appeared that all the Gods from heaven came down to earth to the holy town of Rishikesh to bask in the glory of the Master. The powerful Himalayas and the divine Ganges echo the sounds of joy and the laughter of the devotees. </P>
<P>&nbsp;Today is Gudi Padwa and Ugadi --- the new year celebrated in many parts of India. All 350 devotees went for a dip in the holy Ganges at 4:30 a.m. with Guruji oblivious to the temperature of the river. This was a new start to the new year in the presence of the Divine. </P>
<P>&nbsp;The most renowned, 75-year old saint of Rishikesh, Swami Pragyanandji had a vision in which he saw Guruji as Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh with many arms. He then performed a puja to Guruji.</P>

<P>It is better not to be a seeker so that you blame less. But then a seeker (<I>sadhak</I>) also enjoys everything much more. There is more love in life and more pain. When there is more joy, the contrast is greater. A certain level of maturity is needed to see things as they are and not to blame the path, the self, and the world. Do you see what I am saying?</P>
<P>It is like a quantum leap. If one jumps across this threshold then there is no fall.</P>
<P>The Divine does not test you. Testing is part of ignorance. </P>

<P>&nbsp;Picnic to Neelkant hills and holy Haridwar was a grand finale to the Rishikesh course, followed by a wild Satsang in New Delhi. It was so charged! Guruji is back in the Ashram for a quiet three days before his Australian tour.</P>
<P>&nbsp;From U.K.: Guruji had given a rose to a lady on February 13 and they called to say that the flower was still amazingly fresh and fragrant after six weeks! This miracle inspired an otherwise unwilling lady to do the course.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Important exercise: Find out what it is that has been with you forever. Belma says that she asked herself this question 20 years ago and she knows all the answers. And that there is only one answer . . . . (Laughter)</P>

<P>When someone is drowning in the ocean of attachments, surrender is the life jacket they can put on and wait for the rescue team. Without fighting the attachments, observe the feverish breath and go to the cool place of silence within. Your first step in this direction is directing your attachment to the Knowledge, to the Divine.</P>

<P>&nbsp;Thursday being Rama's birthday, Guruji gave a talk on Rama. It was stunning. Then we went to Madras for Satsang. Many dignitaries came to take Guruji's blessing, including the ex-President of India and his family. Brilliant questions and answers provided a moving Satsang.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Singapore snatched a Satsang on the way to Australia.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Perth packed them in and Sydney was swirling. Two fundamentalists verbally attacked Guruji as soon as he entered the hall, shocking the audience. Unshaken, Guruji delivered a powerful and eloquent discourse.</P>
<P>&nbsp;In Ipswich, near Brisbane, Marcy taught a course. To the amazement of all the participants, the image of an Indian Goddess appeared on the leaf of a plant.</P>

    <P>&nbsp;After a beautiful advanced course in Melbourne Australia, Guruji is now in joyful Jakarta. Guruji was received with great fanfare at the airport by Kim and her entourage. Then Guruji blessed the land for a new Ashram. The initiative for this was taken by our dear Kim's husband, Mr. Tolani. Jakarta is vibrating with four Satsangs a day and flooding with tears of joy and devotion.</P>

      <P>&nbsp;We attach meaning to words and we distort them, too. For example, the word "brainwashing." Like your body, your brain needs washing sometimes. You don't want to walk around with a dirty brain, a dirty mind. What is wrong with the word "brainwashing?" It indicates a clean brain, a clean mind, but it is used in a derogatory manner. </P>
<P>&nbsp;Like that, the word "disillusionment." It is good that you are disillusioned. You have come to reality. Like <I>purana.</I> It means "that which is new in the town, the most modern." But it is used in the sense of being old. In the course of time, meanings of words change. The word "enthused" comes from the Greek which means "God is with us." Then it came to mean crazy, and now it's changed again.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Don't be stuck with the words. Your worries are words. Your ideas are words. Wisdom is beyond words. It is the very Being. It is the essence of all words. See and relate beyond words. Then there is no lie in your life.</P>
<P>&nbsp;If you manipulate words, it is a lie. If you play on words, it is a joke. If you rely on words, it is ignorance. If you transcend words, it is wisdom.</P>

<P>&nbsp;Guruji was welcomed with the traditional Balinese dance and garlands. Then the press and TV crews invaded the hotel and splashed the news throughout Indonesia. All the press people were put into silent meditation and they came out with big smiles. Now they are arranging courses.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Everything was magical. A thousand stars reflected over the Indian Ocean and the cliff side pool. Surprisingly, this course did not have chaos! The harmony on the course was so great that the hotel staff spontaneously started observing silence, communicating only through gestures and notes. Mr. and Mrs. Tolani and their whole team did a great job.</P>
<P>&nbsp;After the farewell dinner outside by the lotus pools, we enjoyed a Balinese dance drama from the Ramayana. Afterwards we had a lively Satsang as drops began to fall from the heavens. Everyone was singing and dancing in the rain with Guruji.</P>

  </B><P>&nbsp;Strange are the ways of Karma. The more you understand it, the more amazed you become. It brings people together and separates them. It causes some to be weak and some to be strong. It makes some rich and some poor. All the struggle in the world, whatever it may be, is the bondage of Karma. It cuts across all logic and reasoning. This understanding will lift you from getting stuck to the events or personalities and help you in your Journey to the Self.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;Question: So a thief can say it is my karma to steal?</P>
  <P>&nbsp;Answer: Then the police have the karma to catch him too! (Laughter)</P>
  <P>&nbsp;Only human life has the ability to be free from Karma. And only a few thousands aim to be free from it. Only through Grace can the bondage of Karma be burnt. Performing actions cannot eliminate Karma.</P>

  <P>&nbsp;In Singapore, huge crowds welcomed Guruji. Scores of people had to be turned away from a Public Utility Auditorium. Many dignitaries including ministers and officials of Singapore and Malaysia were present. Among the others were Chinese musicians and Indian dancers. There were four wonderful Satsangs a day and delightfully delicious food everywhere. Many courses, including those in the corporate sector, are in progress. The highlight of the tour was an unexpected awakening talk on the Upanishads that left everyone spellbound and speechless.</P>

<P>&nbsp;The skies opened and grace poured down in buckets at the Ashram this week. It was a confluence of eight prominent saints of India who in a private meeting honored Guruji in one of their ashrams. Each of these saints gives lectures or Darshan to hundreds of thousands of devotees and they all run their own schools, hospitals and ashrams. Four of them who were just introduced to Guruji followed us for a brief tour of our Ashram.</P>
<P>&nbsp;When they were all at Sumeru Mantap, lightening and thunder surrounded us and everyone was drenched and then they ran to Guruji's kutir. Immediately these very popular and formal Sanyasis began to shed their orange garments. But what to give them to wear? Guruji gave them all white dhotis. Soon they were all wearing our Guruji's white dhotis and being fed by his hand looking more and more like a group of joyful children happy to be home again. Somehow in their "new clothes" they began to relax and smile and laugh and soon the grace of our Guru had them radiating from deep inside. </P>
<P>&nbsp;All of us were shocked to see how the formal heads of institutions were transformed and by the time they were leaving, they humbly asked for Guruji's blessings and invited him to their ashrams and to lead them in meditation. They said, "Mother Nature gave us all a bath before entering your temple, Guruji." We stood and watched this event with awe and laughter.</P>
<P>&nbsp;The first advanced course has started at the Ashram.</P>

<P>&nbsp;On the way back from Holland to the German Ashram we had a picnic on the banks of the river Rhine near beautiful Boppard.</P>
<P>&nbsp;The Ashram was filled to its capacity. Teacher Training Phase 1 and 2 and the advanced course were in full swing.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Our spring water has a mind of its own. It flows for some people when they go near it and stops for others. Whenever Kirpal went with Guruji's jug, the water joyfully rushed forth!</P>

        <P>Today marks the one year anniversary of these Knowledge Sheets. The year which started in Big Sur and is ending in St. Louis, began in KNOWLEDGE and is concluding in SEVA. Knowledge Sheets now go to more than 300 Satsang groups touching 7000 people every week around the world!</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>SEVA IS SAVIOR</B></P>
      
      <P>&nbsp;The way to expand from individual to universal consciousness is to share others's sorrow and joy. As you grow, your consciousness should also grow. When you expand in Knowledge with time, then depression is not possible. Your inner most source is joy.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;The way to overcome personal misery is to share universal misery! The way to expand personal joy is to share universal joy. Instead of thinking "what about me?" "what can I gain from this world?" think "what can I do for the world?" When everyone comes from the point of contributing to society, you have a Divine society. We have to educate and culture our individual consciousness in order to expand in time with the Knowledge . . . from "what about me?" to "what can I contribute?"</P>
      <P>&nbsp;If you are not having good experiences in meditation, then do more seva -- you will gain merit and your meditation will be deeper. When you bring some relief or freedom to someone through seva, good vibrations and blessings come to you. Seva brings merit; merit allows you to go deep in meditation; meditation brings back your smile.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>&nbsp;<B>Answer to last week's riddle:</B> </P>
      <P>&nbsp;That something which is so precious to you is your smile -- your joy. You lose it in the world and find it in the self, in Satsang. If you can't find it here, at the Ashram, forget about it. Your can't find it anywhere.</P>

      <P>&nbsp;After a quick two day stopover in Boston with overflowing crowds at Interface and Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, and with lively late night Satsangs, Guruji arrived in Pittsburgh to a packed schedule of household Satsangs, temple visits, two lectures, and a celebration to inaugarate our new Center complete with cake flying in all directions! Guruji caught up on rest and met many new devotees in Cleveland before arriving today in St. Louis.</P>

    <P>&nbsp;When we are joyful, we don't look for perfection. If you are looking for perfection then you are not at the source of joy. Joy is the realization that there is no vacation from wisdom. The world appears imperfect on the surface but underneath, all is perfect. Perfection hides; imperfection shows off. </P>
    <P>&nbsp;The wise will not stay on the surface but will probe into the depth. Things are not blurred; your vision is blurred. Infinite actions prevail in the wholeness of consciousness. And yet the consciousness remains perfect, untouched. As Satsangees, realize this now and be at Home.</P>

    <P>&nbsp;<B>NEWS FLASH from BBC (Beautiful British Columbia)</B>:</P>
    <P>&nbsp;In St. Louis a man diagnosed with a malignancy in his shoulder came to receive Guruji's blessings. The next day he came to Satsang and to the astonishment of the doctors, the man had been healed even though the MRI had shown a tear and a growth on the shoulder cuff. As the man told his story and presented a dozen red roses to Guruji, tears of gratitude rolled down everyone's cheeks. There were many reported healing experiences in St. Louis and Chicago.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;The Chicago organizers said, "Here comes the Art of Living circus to town." (Laughter) There was an air of celebration as the devotees from the U.S. Midwest gathered with non-stop giggling and laughter. People were driving in circles, forgetting traffic rules, not sleeping, and laughing as Guruji (our sit-down comedian) amazed everyone.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;We rushed on to Portland. Dean says we have become Rushins instead of American, Indians, and Canadians. At The Old Church, there was not even standing space. The sight of Guruji put smiles on every face.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;In Vancouver, the Aboriginal People warmly hosted Guruji at the University of British Columbia. The sky, the sea, the snow-capped mountains, the tall trees and the waterfalls all beckoned for the Knowledge.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Sudarshana left the room for five minutes and returned asking, "What did I miss?" Marcy said, "Enlightenment!" (Laughter)</P>

      <P>Though you have heard "don't judge," judgement comes unavoidably in day-to-day life. By the actions and behaviors of people, you either approve or disapprove. But always remember that everything is changing, and do not hold onto the judgement. Otherwise your judgement gets solidified like a rock. It brings misery for you and for others.</P>
<P>If judgements are lighter like air, like a breeze, they bring in fragrance, then move away. They could bring a foul smell, then move away. They should not stay there forever.</P>
<P>Judgements are so subtle that you are not even aware of their existence. Judging or labeling someone as judgmental is also a judgement. Only in the state of Being when you are full of love and compassion can you ever be free from all judgements.</P>
<P>Yet the world cannot move without judgements. Until you judge something as good or bad, you cannot do any actions. If you see rotten apples in the market, you say, "No good." Good ones you buy. If someone lies to you ten times, you think next time it also could be a lie. A judgment happens automatically.</P>
<P>See the possibility that people and things can change at any time and don't hold onto the judgements.</P>
<P>You need to judge your company. Your company can pull you up or pull you down. The company that drags you towards doubt, dejection, blame, complaints, anger, delusion, and desires is bad company. The company that pulls you up towards joy, enthusiasm, service, love, trust, and Knowledge is good company.</P>
<P>When someone complains, first you listen, then you nod, then you sympathize, then you complain.</P>
<P>Robert says, "Join the party." Denise says, "I confess, you are absolutely right." (Laughter)</P>
<P>Your company can create Hell for you in Heaven -- or Heaven for you in Hell. Judge for yourself . . . !</P> 		</font>

  		<P>&nbsp;<B>The Circus goes to Ottawa:</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;Enthusiastic Suzannah and party had organized a hall at the palatial Chateau Laurier. There was Guruji, sitting on his beautifully decorated seat next to a huge pile of super-sized bananas. In the darshan line he had to hand out over 300 bananas, one by one, like a banana vendor. There were piles of bananas everywhere.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Guruji said, "Let's all close the eyes and meditate," and everyone was sitting there peeling their bananas. Denise got stuck with her banana peel. She didn't know what to do with it. She (and everyone else) ended up meditating while holding their banana or banana peel like some kind of religious ceremony.</P>
<P>Thanks to Janice, the Ayurvedic Course at the Ashram was a great success. The celebration continues in Montreal . . .</P>

          <P>&nbsp;<B>NEWS FLASH</B>:</P>
    <P>&nbsp;We emerged from silence to celebrate at the lake the fifth anniversary of the Ashram. It was like a fairytale with the full moon rising above the trees, the sounds of Susannah's and Phillip's flutes, fireworks, and bonfires. The Guru took us spinning in circles on a raft and to our surprise brought us back to the same shore. In the confusion, we forgot to serve the anniversary cake.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;After the Montreal talk, Denise drove off with Guruji in the car with all the doors open. Ramola ran from behind and jumped in. In the fever to get into the Guru's car, somebody left luggage behind, another left a purse, another left their shoes, and they all left their minds.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Guruji and Phillip have just left for Toronto and then are to go to Colorado.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;On the 14th of July an Interfaith Prayer and Meditation Conference will be sponsored by the Art of Living in Washington DC. Ten Swamis from India have been invited. </P>
    <P>&nbsp;Thomas called Punditji to tell him that a forest fire raging at Lake Tahoe which burned many million dollar houses, came up to his property, burned his tool shed, but stopped at his front door. Neither his home -- where many Satsangs had been held -- nor his garden were damaged.</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>SURRENDER AND RESPONSIBILITY</B></P>
      
      <P>Setting up a time-bound goal gives direction to the life force. Imagination is essential for this. Most people have a small imagination and are stuck with that, and that causes frustration. But if you are a devotee, you say "Let Thy Will be done" and then you will step lightly to the goal. You will take it easy. We have to make a distinction. Some people say "Let God do everything and surrender" and others say "I have to be responsible."</P>
      <P>Surrender is saying "Let Thy Will be done" and "Thy Will" for you is to take responsibility for the whole world.</P>
      <P>It appears to be opposing and conflicting in nature -- in fact they are two sides of the same coin. The more you surrender, the more responsive you become. One who is irresponsible cannot surrender either. Why is someone irresponsible? They are lazy or fearful or both. If you are lazy or fearful, you cannot be in love.</P>
      <P>Total responsibility is total surrender. It's a little hard to chew, but this is the truth. People usually say either I take responsibility or surrender, but I tell you they go hand in hand. Suppose you are surrendered to the Knowledge. That means you are committed to sharing it with others. You take responsibility to see that it flourishes.</P>
      <P>Question: The confusion comes with the doership?</P>
      <P>Answer: When you are taking responsibility and you find blocks, remember "surrender." That gives you strength to move ahead. It releases you from the weight of the doership. Responsibility is the dynamic expression of life in the present moment. When you are shaken, remember the basis of responsibility as surrender.</P>
      <P>Taking responsibility or surrendering without doership is the skill of the wise. Total irresponsibility is impossible for you. Limited responsibility makes you weak. A little water in the sun will evaporate but the ocean never dries up. Limited responsibility tires you out. Unlimited responsibility empowers you and brings you joy.</P> 		</font>

      <P>&nbsp;The fireworks arrived July 4th with Guruji at Colorado's largest advanced and basic courses ever. The hall was dressed with red, white, and blue balloons and ribbons in celebration of Independence (of the United States and our spirits). As we watched the explosions spread across the horizon, Guruji said, "That looks just like your minds." Guruji took a hike in the mountains and then met an enthusiastic crowd in Colorado Springs before flying on to California. There was a Satsang in Anu and N.J.'s home in Apple Valley for over 150 devotees before the Art of Living entourage moved on to northern California. There have been non-stop talks and Satsangs celebrating Guruji's summer tour to the U.S.</P>

Represented were the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Bahai's, Buddhism, Church of Christ, Islam, Sufism, the Unity Church, Free Masonry, Hinduism, Presbyterian and Sikh, among others. An African holy man swathed in flowing white robes bowed before each delegate and the audience. </P>
        <P>The nine Swamis from India, in their golden robes, dramatically entered the auditorium during the program and gave their blessings to Guruji. Guruji, sitting in the center of them all, provided the closing meditation. John was master of ceremonies and did a wonderful job staying centered amidst the chaos of program changes that nobody even noticed!</P>

    <P>The healthiest way to apply this knowledge is to see the whole past as happening and the present as doing. If you see the past as doing, then ego and regret come along. And when you see the present as happening, then laziness and unawareness set in. If you apply the doing for the future, it brings tension and worry. If you apply the happening for the future, it might bring some confidence and also lethargy.</P>
    <P>Let the happening be for the past. Let the doing be for the present. And the future is a mix of both.</P>

You are not part of the Master. When someone gives you something, you are grateful. That means you feel separate. You are not grateful to yourself.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;Gratefulness is inevitable. When you go beyond gratefulness, then union happens. No "I," no "you" remains. You are part of the Master. You are just One Being with a thousand heads and a thousand arms, but with one heart. You have got to be grateful on the path, but you have to transcend gratefulness. Better stop being grateful.

      <P>&nbsp;When you are grateful then <I>you</I> are the center, <I>you</I> are more important. When you are grateful to God for having received something beautiful, for example, eyesight, who is important? You or God? You! So your gratitude indicates ego.</P>

      <P>&nbsp;Guru Purnima was celebrated all around the world. In the German Academy, people who had been there earlier could not believe their eyes. The Seva Warriors had made such a magic on the whole building. The "Moonwalk" on the mountain after Satsang was simply great and everyone was full!</P>

        <P>Mr. John Pb: But people with good intellect seem to have less faith.</P>
        <P>Guruji: They have more faith in the matter. Head puts the faith in the matter more and heart puts the faith in the abstract more.</P>
        <P>It's next to impossible that one can be in total lack of faith or total lack of devotion. It's only a question of balance.</P>

        </B><P>Guruji arrived at the Washington airport and drove to three Satsangs and had dinner, then dinner, then dinner. Next day Bhanu shopped from 10 am to 5 pm.</P>
        <P>Bhanu says, "Don't write that!"</P>
        <P>Dr. Ganesh Prabhu, one of the leading cardiovascular surgeons, formerly of Johns Hopkins Hospital, asked if he could sit and meditate alone with Guruji without anyone else around. The deal was struck. Dr. Prabhu used a holter monitor on Guruji to measure the heart function while he was meditating. Afterwards Guruji departed for Los Angeles.</P>
        <P>Dr. Prabhu called Guruji at about 8:00 that evening with the information that the heart rate recorded went from 10 per minute to 2 and stopped completely twice. He was even more excited and amazed that the machine kept recording a heartbeat for nearly 10 hours after being disconnected from Guruji. He asked, "What happened? What happened?" His joy knew no limits. Never before in his career had he seen anything like this. He said he would frame the read-out.</P>
        <P>Guruji arrived in Los Angeles for the long-awaited Summer Celebration. Sixty people were on seva teams with Ann McFadden at the helm. Nine swamis who were our guests began an intensive sightseeing campaign, dragging Wally and John through Disneyland, Universal Studios, and Sea World starting at 8:00 in the morning. Often you could hear the swamis saying, "Where is Honey?" (Wally's motor home.)</P>
        <P>There was a grand Satsang in San Diego with the Swamis. Then as Guruji arrived in L.A. there was a memorable Prayer Conference evening at the famous Agape Center. Everyone spoke about unity. Then Guruji stood up and shocked the audience by saying, "Unity is impossible." He continued by explaining that in order for there to be unity, there has to be two. Yet there is only One in the whole universe.</P>
        <P>Next day Guruji gave a beautiful talk at the Unity Church in Tustin. "All of your life becomes a meditation," he said. "Whether you look at the trees or the flowers or talk with people, you are in meditation." He encouraged people to stay with their daily meditation practice. After the talk we all looked up and saw a big puffy heart in the clear blue sky. That evening there was an electrifying Satsang with many birthdays at the Doubletree Hotel with 350 course participants.</P>

          <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>INFINITE PATIENCE AND SMART SHOPPING</B></P>
          
          <P>Suppose you go to God, get a boon, and walk away. When your intention is to get a boon, then you are in a hurry. Another person who knows he owns God is not in a hurry for anything. Infinite patience comes up in him.</P>
          <P>When you know you own God, you are not in a hurry to get something out of God. Your hurry to get something throws you off balance and makes you small. Have "eternal wait," infinite patience. When you have infinite patience, you will realize God belongs to you. Either through awareness or through practice you reach the same spot.</P>
          <P>Question: What do you mean by "owning God?"</P>
          <P>Answer: The Divinity belongs to you. It's not like shopping at the supermarket in a hurry and rushing back home. When you see the whole store is at home, you are not in a hurry to shop. You are at ease.</P>
          <P>Question: To develop patience do we just observe the impatience?</P>
          <P>Answer: Just observe the thoughts and feelings and don't regret about it.</P>
          <P>When you know you are part of the divine plan, you stop demanding. Then you know everything is being done for you. You are taken care of. Usually we do it the other way: we hurry the mind and are slow in our action. Impatience means hurry in the mind; lethargy means slowness in action. Patience in the mind and dynamism in action is the right formula.</P> 		</font>

          <P>It was a big week. Newspapers published articles, television ran interviews, and hundreds came to attend intro and advanced courses. Teachers from all over North America are being revised and revived. </P>
          <P>No one was concerned about the Blackout of( Ñ¹6XXXXX), which affected six states between Canada and Mexico, because Guruji promised the lights would come on before the talk. And they did! </P>
          <P>For people who do not have a teacher in their area and/or have not taken the Intro Course, Guruji is structuring an evening of chanting and knowledge. More on this soon.</P>

The head that bends in surrender will never have to bend in shame. Shame accompanies arrogance. Shyness accompanies Love. See how children are endowed with shyness, that is natural. Shyness is inherent. Shame is inflicted by society and is acquired. Shame brings guilt and shyness adds to oneÒ³ beauty. Retain your shyness and drop your shame.</P> 		</font>

<P>Parag and Parul were taken by surprise when the food brought just for Guruji and four others was fed to forty people and still there was some left over.</P>
<P>The Advanced Teacher Training was immensely beneficial and the teachers left with renewed wisdom and fire. </P>
<P>As people would crowd into Verna's home and the slamming of car doors after midnight was awakening the entire Bayliss neighborhood, so Guruji played a trick and took everyone to the beach! A big group gathered in the airport, there was a change in flight, and the airport authorities requested our people not to crowd! Rajshree's family hosted a nice Satsang in Yonkers. A public Satsang was given for the first time in Princeton, New Jersey and the talk in New York was greatly admired by everyone. Guruji gave four television programs in this tour, including The Discovery Channel and Korean TV. Before boarding the plane to the UK, Guruji took a private visit to the amusement park (with only 40 people) and the water rides and the roller coaster were great fun. </P>

        <P>Guruji: Whether you win or lose an argument with me you are still laughing. Why?</P>
        <P>Because there is total sense of belongingness. When there is a total sense of belongingness, real play happens. Winning or losing is irrelevant.</P>

        <P>We recognize that many people will say, "There was no Knowledge Fax this week." Of course, they are mistaken. Some people will say, "The Guru finally missed a deadline. Of course, He is just human, like everyone else. He probably ran out of things to say, got tired. Maybe there was no computer nearby. Maybe he called in sick." Some people, asleep, may not have noticed.</P>
        <P>However, knowing that the Guru is communicating even when He says nothing at all, we seek the deeper meaning of the week's Knowledge Sheet or Nonsheet. Let us simply say, We seek the deeper meaning of this week's Sandesh. </P>
        <P>Option 1: It is all changing</P>
        <P>Everything is changing. Nothing stays for all time. "Life is teaching us, at every moment, the art of letting go." Even Knowledge Faxes will not be there for ever. Letting Go. Ultimately we must let go of even the Knowledge as object, as something "out there."</P>
        <P>Option 2. I am the Knowledge </P>
        <P>Living the knowledge, becoming the knowledge. That is what we must aspire to. The Knowledge Fax is not just a piece of paper, a bit of amusement each week, which titillates the intellect and which we promptly forget, and go about our meaningless and mundane lives. </P>
        <P>Sub-Option 2.1. "Enough Knowledge has been given. Digest that." </P>
        <P>We must assimilate the Knowledge that has already been given, make it a part of us. There is a rhythm in all things. The cycle of the year goes around again. The cycle of the Knowledge as well. Let us remember and re-learn the knowledge given in the previous cycle. </P>
        <P>Option 3. Grace and Gratitude </P>
        <P>"To those who have, more will be given. To those who have not, even what little they have will be taken away from them. " </P>
        <P>How much gratitude have we had for the Knowledge that has been given each week? How much have we valued the Knowledge Faxes? How much awareness, how much attention have we put on them? Have they become just another routine, something else to take for granted? Wherever we put our attention, that will increase. Have we not put enough attention on the Knowledge Sheets each week?</P>
        <P>Option 4. Silence </P>
        <P>Truth is beyond words. Therefore whatever we speak is false. Only in silence can we know the Truth. Only in silence can we be the Truth. </P>
        <P>Meditate. Be silent. Know thy Self. </P>
        <P>Option 5. The Unbaked Pot </P>
        <P>When you pour water into an unbaked pot, the water is wasted, and so is the pot. Before you put water into a pot, you should bake the pot. The Guru is now baking all the pots. When they are baked, then he will be able to fill them with the water of Knowledge. But for now, why waste all that good water? </P>
        <P>Objection: But how can the pots be baked without the Fire of Knowledge? </P>
        <P>This is a very good point. I suppose there are other fires. The fire of criticism and humiliation; the fire of hunger; the fire of lust; the fire of longing; the physical fire of heat. You should ask the Guru to speak on the five fires. </P>
        <P>Option 6. The Answer to Last Week's Non-riddle </P>
        <P>Look for the meaning hidden in all the events. And a non-event is also an event. There was a "sandesh" contained within the box of Sandesh sweets given to the Guru last week. Similarly, what is the meaning hidden in this week's non-fax?</P>
        <P>"Let those who have ears hear." Hearing the silence. This is what we must do. </P>
        <P>Option 7. Just Testing </P>
        <P>The Guru is testing our level of dismay at not receiving a fax this week. It seems that the level of dismay was appropriately high, as it now appears a fax has indeed been sent, albeit belatedly. (I just called Bill Hayden. Poor Bill. Apparently a good proportion of the people on the continent also called him.) </P>
        <P>So what to read into this? Possibility: The Guru is soft-hearted, he cannot bear our disappointment. Or: The Guru is disappointed. We did not receive the silent fax he sent; so he was obliged to send a fax containing words. Or: The Guru is pleased. Our collective dismay at not receiving a fax this week proved to him that we do deeply value the Knowledge given each week and we are extremely grateful or ? ? ?</P>
       
        <P>P.P.S. The above Knowledge Fax Supplement was sent by Susannah and the Ottawa Satsang group on 21st September regarding Knowledge Fax #67. </P>

    <P>People who are free, regret that they don't have discipline. They keep promising that they will become disciplined. People who are disciplined look for the end. (Discipline is not an end in itself, it is a means.)</P>
    <P>Look at the people who have no discipline; they are miserable. Freedom without discipline is absolute misery. Discipline without freedom is suffocating.</P>
    <P>Orderliness is monotonous and chaos is stressful.</P>
    <P>We have to make the discipline free and the freedom disciplined.</P>
    <P>People who are in company all the time, they look for the comforts of solitude. People who are in solitude, feel so lonely and want to be in company.</P>
    <P>People who are in a cold place want to be in a warm place. People who are in a warm place love something cool.</P>
    <P>This is the dilemma of life: Everyone is looking for perfect balance. Perfect balance is like a razor's edge. It can only be found in the self.</P>

    </B><P>The big advanced course at the ashram of Kripalu Maharaj (the founder of Kripalu Yoga) at Kayavaran in India brought celebration to the ashram. It was all so well organized that there were no complaints and no one felt lost in the big group. There was one teacher taking care of every 25 people. People were sharing so many miraculous stories.</P>
    <P>The outdoor Satsangs in the moon light and Christmas lights simply transformed the place into Brindavan. On the last evening, Guruji appeared in pink silks and was adorned with a crown of beautiful flowers and a peacock feather. Guruji received 400 garlands from devotees. Each garland that hung around Guruji's neck, when being removed took a few hairs with it.</P>
    <P>This was a course that started in bliss and ended in chaos. Even though people thought there was no chaos, an impatient aeroplane left Guruji behind after the course, whereas the next plane in the next city and after a three-hour drive, graciously took Him and His group as the last passengers. The race did not end until He boarded His international connecting flight -- again as the last passenger . . . </P>

      </B><P>German Ashram had an intense Teachers Training Course. Guruji went up to Minsk and Belarus, where people had come from as far as Siberia. As many people met Guruji for the first time, it was like a dream come true for them. Virtually everybody had a miraculous experience to tell. One family had spent 7 months salary to come to meet Guruji. Another family sold their house to meet Gurudev. Over 1000 people filled the stadium and the auditorium looked splendid and all the teachers had worked hard to make the stadium look splendid and magnificent. People from Lithuania, St. Petersburg, Moscow, Minsk, and many other towns had gathered in a very festive mood. Russian television covered Guruji's arrival in Mumbai. There was a grand reception for Guruji. When he sat on his seat, all the flowers over him seemed to reach out for his Darshan. It seemed as if there was a waterfall of flowers and Guruji was smiling in the center. In the evening, Guruji was presented with two flowers, with which he played around for hours and kept posing for photographs. The conversation was diverted to the lotus flowers.</P>

    <P>Q: Many ask for blessings but only a few will receive it.  Why?</P>

    <P>A: The giver is anyway giving but the taker is not there - the sincerity is missing.  One who gives blessings gives it freely but the one who receives it has to be sincere.  Sincerity is the qualification to receive blessings.  And everyone is free to be sincere at any point of time or space.</P>
    
    <P>Q: Why do people choose to be sincere only sometimes?</P>
    
    <P>A: Because of the illusion that they are going to miss some mundane pleasure.  Hankering after pleasure makes them insincere.  When you are sincere you simply enjoy pleasure.</P>
    
    <P>Poor people fight for food.  Rich people share their food.  Richer are those people who share power.  Richer still are those who share fame.  Richest are those who share themselves.  Richness of a person is indicated by his ability to share and not by what he hoards.  Godliness is enjoying sharing fame.</P>

The whole Ashram was so vibrant with Divine energy that the renowned pundits who had performed so many Yagyas felt the difference.  As the Pundits became busier, the devotees became serene and still.  The silence was thick and profound and the celebration was loud and colorful.  And with each passing day Guru Dev grew younger and more radiant.  Those who walked near Guru Dev's Kutir would experience different fragrances which kept changing every few minutes!</P>

      <P>In the Ashram some people wanted white bread to be served at breakfast.  Some were opposed to this and it caused a big conflict (laughter) because they couldn't find any other reason to be in conflict.  Just one phone call from Guruji set everyone in astonishment.</P>
      
      <P>The diplomatic reception, the piles and piles of flower and the smiling crowd at the airport was a great part of the Taipei event.  Guruji addressed a group of medical professionals in the afternoon and an interfaith conference attended by many religious leaders in the evening.  An advanced course followed on the hilltop retreat center.  The experiences of the people were great.  One lady in her mid-thirties had been in a wheelchair and could not walk for several years.  She started walking after she met Guruji on the previous advanced course.  On the last day of the course, Sharmila and Guruji cooked for 20 volunteers who stayed back to clean up, and you know what?  When dinner was served, 60 people showed up!  All were fed with the food left over.</P>
      
      <P>Amid tears and laughter the party moved</P>
      <P> on to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  The honorable Minister for Works was present at the official launching of the Malaysian Art of Living Society.  Several prominent leaders came to take blessings from Guruji.  One of them asked, &quot;What is the limit of want?&quot;  Guruji said, &quot;Unhappiness.&quot;  It was a colorful evening with Satsang and dinner.  The lights of the local TV stations were so powerful that the circuit breakers switched off twice!</P>

    <P>lntense desire leads you to devotion.  For desire to get intense, time and the need for the desire are required.  The feeling of gratitude is so overwhelming after the fulfillment of desire that it's achievement loses its charm and significance. </P>
    
    <P>The son of a farmer in India had a life-long desire to go to England and he prayed deeply for it.   Even the news of his trip to England materializing filled him with immense gratitude -- he did not even care whether he went or not. </P>
    
    <P>Often people think that they are unfortunate if their desires don't get fulfilled quickly.  lntense desire can frustrate you or make you prayerful.  In prayerfulness, there is gratitude and devotion.  Any intense experience makes you whole. </P>
    
    <P>Your consciousness is like corn.  With the heat of Knowledge, consciousness pops ups and  becomes white and fluffy. </P> 		</font>

    <P>Guruji and his entourage moved from Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok.  Once again the metal detector beeped.  Guruji gave a fiery Satsang to a multi-ethnic audience.  It has made teachers busy for the next whole month. </P>
    
    <P>With Guruji's arrival, the City of Joy (Calcutta) was overjoyed.  Hoardings and banners all over the city created a stampede at the magnificent GD Birla Sabhaghar city auditorium.  But with the pervading bliss inside, everthing fell into place.  The garden of Bharti and S.B. Ganguly was respendent with lights and melody -- The birds in the garden, the flowers, the decorations (not forgetting Bengali sweets), and smiling faces everywhere.</P>
    
    <P>The pact of cooperation was signed by the Satsangees and the mosquitoes at the Nalban Park Salt Lake which was the venue for the next Satsang in Calcutta on the banks of the lake on a moonlit night.  The team work at Calcutta that was in evidence all through was superlative.</P>

      <P>It is only through merit that you can have faith.  When you lack faith, happiness is neither in the inner nor the outer world.  Happiness springs forth from faith.  Happiness is forgetting the body consciousness.  Pain or sorrow is holding on to the body consciousness.  Whenever you are happy you don't feel the body and when you are miserable, you have aches and pains.</P>

      <P>Question: Then why in meditation is the attention taken to various parts of the body?</P>
      
      <P>Guruji: For an arrow to go forward, you have to pull it back.  In the same way when you take the attention to the various parts of the body, it frees you from body consciousness.</P>

    <P>3. Get frustrated</P>

    <P>None of these will in any way strengthen you.</P>
    
    <B><P>Then what are the options?</B>  See rude behavior in this light:</P>
    <P>1. It indicates the intensity of their commitment</P>
    <P>2. It indicates the amount of stress and insensitivity</P>
    <P>3. It projects the up-bringing of the person</P>
    <P>4. It indicates a behavioral pattern</P>
    <P>5. It shows lack of knowledge</P>
    <P>6. It shows lack of observation of one's own mind and its sensations</P>
    <P>7. It shows you behavior to avoid</P>
    <P>8. It is an opportunity for you to welcome and absorb the rudeness</P>
    <P>9. It strengthens your mind</P>
    <P>10. It unconditions the love that you are</P>
    
    <P>The next time when someone is rude to you, make sure you don't get upset.  Just give back a broad smile.</P>
    
    <P>If you can digest the rudeness, nothing whatsoever can shake you.</P> 		</font>

    <P>Guruji came from Delhi for an overnight stay at the Ashram and left the next morning to Kerala.  Organizers in Delhi as well as in Cochin (Trivandrum and Trichur) had experienced very clearly the non-doership of the big event.  Everything fell in its space at the right moment as always.  Enthusiastic devotees in Cochin renovated their homes.  After Cochin, Guruji rushed to the colorful Trichur (In Trichur as usual there was chaos and asana-snatch).  Excellent team work and elaborate arrangements were appreciated by thousands who came to the Satsang.  The Kerala-style decorated elephants with umbrellas and the ballkas dressed in traditional attire carrying lights and flowers were a spectacular welcome.  Many people shared their amazing healing experiences.  Then the whole troop moved to Trivandrum, the town of infinity.  The king of Kerala received Guruji at the Senate Hall with a packed audience of 4000 people.  Colorful umbrellas, elephants, the traditional horns and drums and the Vedic chanting filled the air.  People were enraptured for a three and a half hour program.  The next morning newspapers were filled with the news of the Art of Living Satsang.</P>

He told Murli to take some medicine and tapped him on the throat.  Amazingly, Murli was cured in the next few minutes.  It was as though nothing had happened.  He did not listen to Guruji.  He did not even take any medicine.</P>
  
  <P>People came to the Advanced Course for silence and were blasted by loud raucous music from the local village.  People came all the way from Germany for the sunny weather for which Bangalore is known at this time of the year.  They got dreary clouds, chilling wind, and rain.  In addition, there were frequent power cuts which ensured that people took cold water baths in the morning.  GurujiÒ³ voice went hoarse and He needed a tap on His own throat!</P>

The seed is not perfect.  The sapling is not perfect.  It has to cease to be a sapling to become a tree.

  <P>Self-reliance needs enormous courage.</P>

<P>Surrender needs less courage.</P>

<P>A person who cannot surrender cannot be self-reliant either.</P>

<P>If you don't have enough courage to surrender, then it is impossible  for you to be self-reliant.  You simply fool yourself.   People who are afraid to surrender fool themselves.   Because even a little fear is detrimental to self-reliance.</P>

<P>If you don't have a hundred dollars, you cannot have a thousand dollars.</P>

<P>Self-reliance contains surrender.   Fifty dollars contains ten dollars.</P>

<P>Question:    Why does self-reliance need so much courage?</P>

<P>When you want to depend on yourself for everything, there is nobody else, then it needs a lot of courage.</P>

<P>Often people think that surrender is a way to escape from  responsibility and they end up blaming the Divine for all their problems.   In fact, the  true surrender is taking total responsibility for everything.</P>

<P>Susannah:    How can we do that?</P>

<P>You take responsibility and you pray for help.</P>

It was held in a gigantic marble hall; and a choir of seventy school girls serenaded Guruji with well-rehearsed  and enthusiastic bhajans.   An entourage of forty-five devotees traveled from Bangalore to Madras for the occasion.</P>

<P>India's warm December weather, bougainvillea and coconut palms have now been replaced by Switzerland's mist-shrouded Alpine peaks, snow-covered palms, and the swans on Lake Lucerne.</P>

    <P>Different organs of our body are governed by different devas. The solar plexus is connected with the sun, that's why it is called "solar" plexus. When the first rays of the sun fall on the solar plexus, it is very good for your body. Doing <I>Surya Namaskar</I> ("sun salutation") yoga asana in the early morning is very good. The solar plexus has a profound impact on the central nervous system, optic nerves, stomach, and what we usually call "gut feeling." It is the second brain in your body. Usually the solar plexus is slightly bigger than an almond. Studies have shown that with the practice of yoga, meditation, and Sudarshan Kriya, the solar plexus can become as a large as the size of the palm. Then it performs better. It balances the body functions. When the solar plexus expands, the intuitive mind works better. The mind becomes clear and focussed. When the solar plexus contracts, one feels horrible, sad, depressed, and all the negative feelings come.</P>
    <P>Krishna was called Padmanabha, meaning "whose navel is the size of a lotus flower." If you become Padmanabha, you become absolutely creative. Brahma, the Creator, is born out of a blossomed solar plexus.</P>
    <P>These days, the solar plexus remains small, but the tummy keeps getting bigger.</P>

  <P>In <I>Bhakti</I> there are four letters.  It's made up of &quot;bha&quot;, &quot;ka&quot;, &quot;ta&quot;, and &quot;i&quot; (ee).  &quot;Bha&quot; stands for fulfillment and nourishment.  &quot;Ka&quot; stands for knowing - a means of knowing.  &quot;Ta&quot; stands for redeeming, for saving, for salvation.  &quot;I&quot; (ee) stands for <I>shakti</I>.</P>

<P>So in <I>Bhakti</I> four things are there: fulfillment and nourishment; means of knowing; &quot;<I>tarana</I>&quot; or salvation; and energy.  <I>Bhakti</I> saves you.  <I>Bhakti</I> nourishes you.  <I>Bhakti</I> is the means of knowing, the right knowledge.  When <I>Bhakti</I> is there the doubts don't come.  It gives the most energy.  So <I>Bhakti</I> contains as the seed all the four qualities.</P>

<P>All the emotional upheavals one undergoes is because one doesn't know <I>Bhakti</I>.  When all intense feelings flow in one direction that is <I>Bhakti</I>, it becomes <I>Bhakti</I>.  What is the difference between a canal and a flooded field?  In a flood what happens is the water does not have a bank to flow in.  When the water flows within banks you call it &quot;river&quot;.  When water is scattered all over, it's all flooded.  So when the emotions get flooded everywhere, mind is in a mess.  If it is intensely flowing in a direction, then that is <I>Bhakti</I>.  And that is most powerful.</P>

<P>A sign of Intelligence is Surrender or <I>Bhakti</I>.</P> 		</font>

          <FONT FACE="Arial"><P>NEWS FLASH</B> Guruji's party made a lightening tour to Dominica and there was a program organized by the cabinet minister for education and social welfare. The Satsang group met in the airport VIP lounge on the way back during a stop over in St. Lucia (a Caribbean island). There was a diplomatic reception in Curacao (another island near Venezuela) and a big Satsang. For the first public talk there was a full house. On to Panama, where Martine and Dr. Chu hosted a large Satsang and then Shirley was the copilot of the small plane that took the group to the Panama Canal. Manu, from Hong Kong, is organizing courses all over Central and South America. Marjorie and her team organized a packed house for a great talk in Costa Rica. This trip gave a huge boost to the spreading of the knowledge throughout the Caribbean and Central America.</P>
    <B><P>Short story</B>: Guruji was walking along the beach with some devotees and there was a huge desalination plant (changes salt water to fresh water) costing millions of dollars. Nearby was a coconut tree. Guruji looked and pointed out that the tree is a natural desalination plant. It takes the salt water from the earth and makes the fresh water inside the coconut. The knowledge is like the tree -- it takes us from salty mud to the pure bliss.</P>

    <B><P>NEWS FLASH</P> </B>Reverend Michael Bechwith, founder of the Agape Church, honored Guruji to his congregation.  Everyone felt the unity inspired by the songs from the church choir and Bhajans by Divya followed by electrifying talks.  Monday Guruji started a series of talks to an overflowing crowd at the Miramar Sheraton Hotel.  A lady in her 50s who had an accident and lost mobility in her arm, came the next day and was amazed that she could now easily lift her arm all the way over her head.  There was an air of celebration and everyone coming to the talks was simply ecstatic.</P>

        <P>You don't need to worry to maintain knowledge. When knowledge is lodged in you as wisdom, it will never leave you. Wisdom lodges itself in your heart. Make the Divine your Valentine (your sweet Beloved). This is the last thing to do and the first thing to do. Keep your heart in a safe place; it is too delicate. Events, small things make strong impressions on it. And you cannot find a better place than the Divine to keep your heart safe and your mind sane. When you keep your heart in the Divine, the moving time, the passing events, will not be able to touch it, will not create a scar. A precious stone needs a setting around it, gold or silver, to hold it and to wear it; so wisdom and knowledge are that setting around the heart which will hold it in the Divine.</P>
        <P>See the Divine in your Valentine and make the Divinity your Valentine (your sweet beloved). Just BE. . .and know that you are LOVED... That is BELOVED.</P>

      <P>Fear is an impression of the past reflecting about the future of the present.  When people deny fear, they become egocentric, when they recognize and accept fear, they go beyond...get free from it.</P>

      <P>Total lack of fear is possible only in utter chaos or utmost orderliness.  A saint or a fool have no fear.  But everywhere in between there is fear.  Fear is essential to preserve orderliness in the world.  It is a primal instinct.</P>
      
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">FEAR OF DEATH PRESERVES LIFE.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">FEAR OF  WRONG KEEPS THE RIGHT.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">FEAR OF SICKNESS BRINGS HYGIENE.</P>
      <P ALIGN="CENTER">FEAR OF MISERY KEEPS YOU RIGHTEOUS.</P>
      
      <P>A CHILD HAS A PINCH OF FEAR SO IT IS CAREFUL AND ALERT WHILE WALKING.  A PINCH OF FEAR IS NECESSARY TO KEEP THINGS MOVING SMOOTHLY.</P>
      
      <P>Because fear is love standing upside down, everything that can be interpreted with Love can also be interpreted with fear.  For example, a child clinging onto its mother.  This can be interpreted in both ways - out of Love or out of Fear.</P>
      
      <P>This primal instinct can be totally transformed through Awareness of Divine Love.</P>
      
      <P>Do not try to eliminate fear.  Just meditate and know that you are nobody or that you belong to someone special...</P> 		</font>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>THREE KINDS OF LOVE</B></P>
      
      <P>There are three kinds of Love.  The Love that comes out of Charm, that which comes out of comfort, and the <B>Divine Love</B>.  Do you see what I am saying?</P>

      <P>The love that comes out of charm does not last long.  It comes out of unfamiliarity or out</P>
      <P> of attraction.  In this you lose the attraction fast, and boredom sets in, like most love marriages.  This love may diminish and bring along with it fear, uncertainty, insecurity, and sadness.</P>
      
      <P>The Love that comes out of comfort and familiarity grows.  But this Love has no thrill, no enthusiasm, joy, or fire to it.  For example, you are more comfortable with an old friend who is a familiar person, rather than with a new person.</P>
      
      <P>The <B>Divine Love</B> supersedes both the above.  The Divine Love has ever newness.  The closer you go, there is more charm and depth.  The Divine Love has comfort, enthusiasm, and familiarity.  There is never boredom and it keeps everyone on their toes.</P>
      
      <B><P>Worldly love can be like an ocean, yet an ocean has a bottom.  The Divine Love is like the sky which is limitless, infinite.  From the bottom of the Ocean, soar into the vast sky.</P>
      </B>
      <P>Anything more about Divine Love?  Refer to our Bhakti Sutras.</P> 		</font>

      <P>During a visit to Adichunchunagiri Ashram, Guruji said that this devotees are waiting for him and he must return soon.  &quot;No, let them wait.  Waiting for the Guru is <I>tapas</I> (penance).  Waiting for the world is <I>tapa</I> (torture),&quot; replied the Swamiji of that ashram.  </P>
      
      <P>In the northeastern region at Guwahati, the jubilant crowd of the generally conservative and closed society turned limitlessly wild.  An elaborate banquet for 1500 devotees followed the Satsang.  Four buses and twelve cars with 180 devotees, left for Shillong, the Meghalayan Capital also called &quot;The Scotland of the East.&quot;  En route, the devotees stopped for a picnic on the banks of a large lake and for rides on a speed boat.  All the satsangees of Shillong behaved like an old bunch, though they were meeting Guruji for the first time.  On his return, Calcutta had a Mega Satsang in the Science city auditorium.</P>
      
      <P>P.S.  Guruji has now arrived in Bangalore.  Sukha Nadi (5,000 year old palm leaf scripture) mentioned Guruji's name and that he is the incarnation of Lord Krishna.  There is a temple of Mother Divine 300 km from the Ashram.  The idol of this deity writes and answers questions of devotees.  This deity visited our Ashram and She &quot;wrote&quot; that she was extremely happy about the work of our Ashram.  She also &quot;wrote&quot; that the spirits of both Lord Krishna and the Mother Divine reside in Guruji.  She also &quot;wrote&quot; that all Guruji's devotees are in the most right path and are peaceful, calm, and settled.</P>

      <P>When your mind is not complaining, responsible, courageous, confident and hollow and empty you are inexplicably beautiful.  A person who cannot correct or act has no right to complain.  And when a person can correct or act, he will never complain. Complaining is a sign of weakness.  Complaining is the nature of utter ignorance where one does not know the Self.  Complaint takes away the Beauty that is inborn in you. And it shows up more on the one who is on this path.</P>

      <P>Worldly mind is a complaining mind; Divine mind is a dancing mind.  Just complaining without indicating the solution is irresponsibility. When the solutions are not workable, finding alternative solutions is Courage.</P>
      
      <P>For external beauty, you put on things; for real Beauty, you have to drop all the things. For external beauty you have to have Make-up; for your real Beauty you only have to realise that you are MADE-UP!</P> 		</font>

But anyway, Guruji moved on to South Africa where he addressed enthusiastic crowds in Pretoria and Johannesburg.  Then on to Botswana where Guruji was received by the President at the State House.  Later, Guruji visited a Government Hospital and distributed toys and gifts of clothes and food to the ailing children in the pediatric ward.  The children loved it!  It was Santa Claus but with a black beard and trim tummy!  Guruji distributed blankets and food to the aged and disabled of the entire village of Modipane.  The people were overwhelmed and greeted Guruji with joy and cheer.  Enthusiastic devotees of Botswana's Art of Living are organizing big basic courses and great satsangs.  The tired group went on an African Safari and found two leopards, five  elephants, a vulture with a broken wing, and two monkeys!  The only enthusiastic person was the guide.

When the time is good, a foe will behave like a friend.  When the time is not good, even a friend will behave like a foe.  The wiser one believes in <I>Mahakala</I> (the Grand time or Shiva).  An ignorant person disbelieves in time and the Divine beyond time.</P>

    </B>
    <P>The discovery of the week is that Guruji has a three piece suit and a mobile phone!  Guruji always has a three piece suit (Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh) and only one suit case!</P>
    <P>The miracle of the week is that the angry, reluctant and uncooperative driver of the &quot;Tour de France&quot; bus has become friendly and very patient with the Art of Living circus.  A big transformation has occurred in him by just being with the group.  Now he believes that Guruji is more successful than president Chirac.</P>
    <P>His only puzzle was that whatever Guruji said was so correct, yet the people in the bus were so different.</P>
    <P>The joke of the week is that by the end of the tour, he started serving us to such an extent that he forgot his own baggage.  The Tour de France gave a big boost to the AoL France.  The advanced course has begun in a beautiful Zen temple.</P>

      <P>How can we reconcile the impersonal with the personal? </P>

      <P>In love you raise the object to life. When you love an object it becomes life. For children everything is personal. Children take each object they play with and make it totally personal. Even a stone has a face; even the sun laughs. When you attach emotion, the whole creation becomes personal.  When you remove the emotion, even people become objects. Violence is removing the emotion.  How a person can kill another person: it is when they do not see them as a person, they see them as an object. But even a stone attracts reverence when it becomes personal. </P>
      
      <P>Dean says: In military training they teach soldiers to see people as killing objects coming toward you that need to be killed first. </P>
      
      <P>Susannah says: In the temple even a stone is elevated to the level of spirit. </P>
      
      <P>The impersonal cannot attract reverence. Most people see God as impersonal and therefore they do not progress. </P>
      
      <P>Dean and Susannah say: "That's why we need a Guru!" </P>
      
      <P>Chan says: When we say something isn't real, then it's impersonal. When we personalize</P>
      <P>something, we make it real. So then, what is reality? </P>
      
      <P>You are the Reality. You are not the thoughts, you are not the emotions nor actions. You are not even a person...! </P>
      
      <P>Exercise: What you now see as impersonal, see it as personal. And when you feel any negative emotion towards anybody, see them as impersonal. And pretend that you yourself are a robot. </P>

      <P>Georgia: That 's why we spend so much time in our minds!</P>

    <P>Question: What do you do if people don't respect you?</P>
<P>Sri Sri Ravi Shankar: Thank them. They have given you freedom. (Laughter and amazement) When people respect you, they often take away your freedom. They expect you to smile at them, recognize them, behave in a certain way with them.</P>
<P>If they don't respect you, you are not obliged to answer their questions and you can drop all the formalities. Either you will be naturally smiling or frowning. So you will be complete.</P>
<P>When people love and respect you, you are obliged to return their courtesies because you don't want to hurt them. When they don't respect or love you, they will not be hurt by your actions and expressions. So they set you free. </P>
<P>When you gain respect, you often do it at the cost of your freedom. Wisdom is to put the freedom first and not bother about respect. </P>
<P>Q: Will freedom not bring arrogance? </P>
<P>A: True freedom is not an "I don't care" attitude. It is lightness from within, a genuine smile and not stiffness. </P>
<P>When someone is stiff and arrogant, they are not really free. True love blossoms only in such freedom. </P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">And when there is genuine love, respect simply follows you. </P> </B>		</font>

A half hour meeting with Guruji totally changed the situation both for the teenagers and the teachers. The American tour ended with an outdoor Satsang at Emerald Bay overlooking Lake Tahoe. Now onto the beginning of the European summer celebrations! </P>

      <P>Sacrifice is letting go of something that you are holding on to or are attached to, which gives you pleasure, for something bigger that would bring good.</P>
      <P>Sacrifice brings strength in life. Life without sacrifice is stagnant. Sacrifice gives you the quantum leap. It takes you to a higher pedestal.</P>
      <P>Often people think sacrifice makes life dull and joyless. In fact, it is the sacrifice which makes life worth living.</P>
      <P>The amount of sacrifice in your life brings out your magnanimity and helps you move out of misery.</P>
      <P>A life without sacrifice is worth nothing. Zeal, enthusiasm, strength and joy are all connected to sacrifice.</P>
      <P>Question: Some people say, "I have sacrificed so much," and complain.</P>
      <P>Answer: That is good. The thought of sacrifice has given them strength to complain and saves them from blaming themselves without which they would even be more depressed.</P>
      <P>Sacrifice never goes unrewarded.</P>
      <P>There can be no love, no wisdom and no true joy without sacrifice.</P>
      <P>SACRIFICE MAKES YOU SACRED. Become sacred!</P> 		</font>

      <P>It is the intellect that divides and that synthesizes. Some creatures in the world only synthesize and some creatures only divide. But the human being has both abilities, he divides and synthesizes. Ants only synthesize, they bring Things Together And Build An Ant Hill. But Monkeys Cannot Synthesize, They Can Only Divide Everything. You Give Them a garland for example, and they tear it to pieces and throw it all over the place. A monkey can only divide, or analyze. But a beaver synthesizes, it brings all the wood together and builds a dam. Birds also synthesize such as the Weaver birds.</P>
      <P>A human being both analyzes and synthesizes. So you analyze from the relative world and synthesize to find the one. The intellect divides to find the truth. Truth once found synthesizes everything.</P>
      <P>When the intellect becomes quiet, it brings out the intelligence. Often people think that gathering information makes one intelligent. This is not so. It is the "<I>samadhi</I>" which brings out the intelligence.</P>
      <P>An unintelligent man, in spite of having all the information, cannot be creative. An intelligent man without much information can be creative.</P>
      <P>A sign of intelligence is to see the one in many and find the many in one.</P>
      <P>There is an old Sanskrit proverb: The first sign of intelligence is not to start anything. The second sign of intelligence is if you have started something, you have to continue it to the end.</P>

For example, if you have taken the Karnataka Express to Bangalore, then there is no need to ask at every station "Where is the train going?".

    </B><P>The festival of Nine Nights of the Mother Divine (Navarathri) has begun. <I>Yagnas</I> are being conducted in these nine days for the peace and prosperity, health and happiness of all devotees (present and future!). More about <I>Yagnas</I> next week.</P>
    <P>The renowned Saint Swami Pragyanandji is in the Ashram, giving discourses on the Shrimad Bhagavatam, as Guruji is in silence.</P>
     <P>&nbsp;All sensory pleasures in the world are like wrapping paper; the true bliss is the present inside. Divine love is the present, yet we are holding onto the paper believing we have already enjoyed the gift. It's like putting the chocolate inside your mouth with the paper still on. A little chocolate may seep into the mouth, but the covering makes sores in the mouth. Unwrap the present. The whole world is there for you to enjoy. The wise know how to enjoy the gift inside, while the ignorant get stuck with the paper.</P>

     <P>&nbsp;Wally told Guruji: I have some property for you to consider as an Ashram in the U.S.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Guruji said: I want every home to be an Ashram.</P>
<P>&nbsp;How many of you consider your home to be an Ashram? If not, what keeps your home from being an Ashram? What are the impediments? What do you think are the qualities of an Ashram?</P>

      <P>Yagna has three aspects:</P>
      <P>1. Deva Puja: Acknowledging and honoring the Divine in all the forms. </P>
      <P>2. Sangatikarana: Hastening the process of evolution by bringing together all the elements and people in creation.</P>

The Meditation Hall has become a feast for the senses. The Ashram is fully lit and so are the faces. The <I>vedic</I> chanting, the beat of the drums, the loud clarinets, the visiting Swamis and the usual ecstatic bhajans have made it magical.</P>
      <P>New clothes and gifts were distributed to the poorest of the poor women from seven villages. For many of them it was the very first gift of new garments in their life and there was such gratitude. The rich fasted and prayed and the poor feasted in this genuine celebration.</P>

<P>God is your child. He/She clings onto to you like a baby till you grow old and die. God keeps crying for nourishment. God clings onto the devotee. He/She needs you to nourish Him/Her in the world. Sadhana, Satsang and Seva are the nourishment. </P>
<P>You always think of God as a father. Then you want to demand and take from God. But when you see God as a child, you have no demands.</P>
<P>Belma says: You cannot pray to a child; you can only pray to your father. </P>
<P>Sri Sri: Why do you want to pray? Why do you want to ask? A good father knows what to give. </P>
<P>Belma: What about surrender?</P>
<P>Sri Sri: Your surrender to a child is more authentic as it has no demand.</P>

      <P>Time and space are infinite.  Grains of sand are countless.  Atoms in the universe are innumerable.  So also the stars, the galaxies.  The same is with the life on this planet.  Neither is there a beginning nor is there an end, because it is all spherical.  A sphere has neither a beginning nor an end, nor a goal, nor a direction.  Truth has no direction, no goal.  Truth itself is the goal and truth is infinite.</P>

      <P>Today is Diwali - the Festival of Lights.  The streets and buildings are lit up with colorful lights.  The four aspects of Diwali:</P>
      
      <P>1.  The lights: Symbolic of spreading the Knowledge.</P>
      <P>2.  Fire crackers: When the explosion happens outside, the explosion inside is diffused.</P>
      <P>3.  Gift exchange and distribution of sweets:  Sweets dispel the bitterness and renew the friendship.</P>
      <P>4.  Feeling abundance: Brings awareness and gratefulness for what one has.</P>
      
      <P>When true wisdom dawns, it gives rise to celebration, and in celebration you may lose focus or awareness.  The ancient rishis knew this so to maintain awareness in the midst of gaiety of celebration, they brought sacredness and puja to every celebration.</P>

Advanced course participants broke all barriers of planning and management as 200 people dropped in without prior intimation. Thanks to the volunteers, smiles prevailed on 500 odd.....!! faces. The Advanced Course participants cleaned up tons of garbage from the banks of the Ganga.</P>
      <P>Note : Indian teachers and Organizers have resolved to start the following Sri Sri Seva Projects ( S S S P) and all the Satsang groups are invited to join in.</P>
      <P>1. Minimum 2% of individual income should be donated towards rural development and hygiene.</P>
      <P>2. Contact your nearest supermarkets / stores and encourage them to use paper or cloth bags instead of plastic bags.</P>
      
      <P>To the USA Satsang Groups</B>:</P>
      <P>As you've recently read in the National Newsletter, Saturday, November 22nd is National Seva Day!!! We encourage all of you to organize and participate in Seva projects in your community as a group. This is a wonderful way to appreciate Guru Dev's message of service, bring the Satsang group closer together, as well as promote the Art of Living as a positive force in the community. </P>
      <P>There are many projects which you can organize. For example, you can volunteer at a local food bank, shelter, or meal distribution center; you can contribute to a convalescence home as visitors to the patients; you can participate in literacy programs for Adult Education or volunteer at schools; and you can affiliate your Satsang with any number of national and local volunteer organizations (such as Habitat for Humanity 1-800-HABITAT, City Cares of America 1-212-533-4734, the Red Cross, the Names Project, etc.). You can be creative--there is so much Seva to be done! You can even look under "Volunteer" in the Yellow Pages! </P>
      <P>Please contact your local teacher for organizational help, and any of us for aid in coming up with ideas, contact information, or anything else we can assist you with! </P>

      <P>1.Have patience and change your expression of love.</P>
      <P>2. Be centered and limit your expression of love. Sometimes over-expression of love puts people off.</P>
      <P>3. Take it for granted that they love you too and accept their style of expression.  For example, a mother with three kids.  One child talks, one child does not talk, one child throws tantrums.  Mother's love is the same irrespective of their behavior.</P>
      <P>4. Genuinely acknowledge their love for you. This will turn your demand into gratefulness and the more you are grateful in life, the more love comes your way.</P>
      <P>5. Know that hurt is part of love and take responsibility for it. When you move away from your center, you will definitely get hurt and the nature of worldliness is misery.</P> 		</font>

      <P>There is also a positive aspect of ego. It drives one to do some work. A person will do a job either out of compassion or out of ego. Most of the work in the society is by boosting the ego. But in Satsang, work is done out of love. Ego is separateness; non-belongingness. It is wanting to prove and to possess. </P>

Baba Avtar Hari Maharaj, a renowned saint from Hardwar is visiting the Ashram and an Advanced course is happening. </P>

      <P>It is the intellect which harbors inhibitions, likes and dislikes, approvals and disapprovals and it is again the intellect which harbors wisdom, which brings forth the intuition.</P>
      <P>Q: Is intuition beyond intellect?</P>
      <P>Ans: Yes, but it moves through intellect. It's the intellect that lodges wisdom.</P>
      <P>Q: Are emotion and intellect contradictory?</P>
      <P>Ans: They can be contradictory.</P>
      <P>Q: When there is a conflict, which is better?</P>
      <P>Ans: There is no better conflict, in conflict. The pure intellect rises beyond conflicts. The pure intellect is not caught up in the emotional turbulence of the mind. Otherwise the intellect often gets coloured by the emotion and becomes impure like muddy water. Then it is unable to reflect the Self. Whereas pure intellect, still and serene, reflects the Self.</P>
      <P>Q: Is intellect affected by Karma?</P>
      <P>Ans: Karma does not afflict the pure intellect. Liberation is purifying the intellect. The Sanskrit word for intellect is Buddhi and one who is liberated is Buddha.</P> 		</font>

            <B><P>NEWS FLASH</P>
      </B><P>Sri Avtar Hari, a well known Saint from Haridwar, blessed the Ashram and was with Guruji for three days. The Russians, Polish, Chinese and other international groups, left for God's own country - Kerala, with Guruji! The first stop at the state capital Thiruvananthapuram saw a gathering of six thousand people. From there the entourage rode to Cochin. At Cochin, the open ground by the seaside was fabulously decorated. Caparisoned elephants in traditional style and little angels with flowers and lamps accorded a warm welcome. The big ground was packed with around ten thousand people. Imagine how much time it took for the Darshan line! Then on to the cultural capital of Kerala - Thrissur where again over five thousand people gathered for a grand satsang in an indoor stadium. The teamwork at Thrissur was a unique example and this time around, the volunteers felt no pressure; they did very little but a lot happened. The entourage proceeded to Calicut. Not a space even for an ant to crawl at the biggest auditorium in Calicut and many had to be content watching the satsang in the closed circuit television placed outside. </P>
      <P>The volunteers did a marvelous job throughout Kerala. Many healing experiences were reported during Satsangs. Guruji is back in the Bangalore Ashram for an other fortnight.</P>

      <P>When the mind contracts, when it is unhappy, time appears to be too long. When the mind expands, when it is happy, time appears to be too short. When the mind is in equanimity, it transcends time.</P>
      <P>When the mind is dull or unconscious, it is unable to experience itself. When the mind is excited or happy, time seems to be too short and when the mind is miserable, time seems to be too long. To escape from the two extremes, many resort to alcohol, sleep etc..... </P>
      <P>Samadhi, no-mindedness or timelessness, is peace, the Real peace. That is the greatest healer. Time is the greatest healer.</P>
      <P>Just like the mind experiences time, this moment has a mind of its own, a Big Mind which has enormous and infinite organizing power. Thought is nothing but a ripple in this moment, and thus a few moments of Samadhi gives the mind a lot of energy.</P>
      <P>Before you fall into slumber or as soon as you wake up from sleep, in the moments of twilight of Consciousness, experience the timelessness!!</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER">Celebration Is Pure Vibration</P>
    </B><P>Human life is a combination of matter, i.e., body and spirit or vibration. Isn't it? Pleasure or joy is becoming intense vibration. Joy is forgetting that you are matter and so you become intense vibration. All the carnal instincts will also make you feel intense vibrations momentarily. And that's how they give a glimpse of joy. But the thing is, it is short lived and it makes you dense later on. Pleasure that comes from Satsang is of a higher nature. Mantra and singing create vibrations in the spirit. That's why when you sing, the ecstasy stays for a long time. Pleasure in the subtle is long lasting, energizing, refreshing and freeing. Pleasure from the gross is short lived, tiring and binding.</P>
    <P>When you know you are electricity (vibration/energy), then craving, greed, lust and anger disappear. And you become true celebration.</P>
    <B><P>Message for Christmas:</B> You are the Christmas tree. The Christmas tree is pointing upwards and its branches grow on all sides. It is orderly. At the time of year when no tree bears anything, it has many gifts to offer. And it is green throughout the year. A Christmas tree bears the gifts and the lights not for itself. All the gifts you are carrying in your life are for others. Anyone who comes to you, you offer them your gifts.</P>
    <P>There were lots of gifts around Sri Sri's couch. John asked Sri Sri, "Are you going to open the gifts?" Sri Sri winked and pointed at the people and said, "I am always opening the gifts." (Laughter)</P>
    <P>Your life is a gift. And you have come to unwrap the gift. In the process of unwrapping, you also save the wrappers. Your whole environment, situations, circumstances and body are the wrapping papers. When we unwrap, we destroy the wrapping paper. We are in such a hurry at times that we even destroy the gifts. With patience and endurance, open your gifts and save the wrapping papers.</P>

It is the test of your strength, commitment, and your focus. You <U>cannot</U> avoid politics, but to harbor it in your mind or <U>not,</U> is your choice. There were politics among the 12 apostles, and with Buddha. And Krishna was in politics from head to toe. And you say you don't want politics? The more you don't want it, the more you will harbor it in your consciousness. When you recognize politics in any group or Satsang, that is a blessing for you to be centered and go inward. You can do that without blaming the group and running away from people, or chickening out. It can enhance your skill to act and <U>not</U> get attached. </P>
      <P>Advantages of politics:</P>
      <P>-- Brings up diversity in people.</P>
      <P>-- Puts in front of you different viewpoints, ways, and tendencies.</P>
      <P>-- Enhances your skill to communicate and act.</P>
      <P>-- Brings centeredness and dispassion.</P>
      <P>-- Shakes you up and makes you stand up to the knowledge.</P>
      <P>-- Enhances your capacity to accept and tolerate.</P>
      <P>-- Makes you realize the whole life is a game.</P>
      <P>Cross the threshold of politics and come to the Divine.</P>

<P>Tolerance is a negative term. If you like something you don't have to tolerate. Tolerance indicates a deep sense of dislike, which can at any time turn into hatred. It indicates a sense of separateness . . small mindedness . . limitation of consciousness.</P>
<P>When you are tolerating, it is a temporary state. Tolerance is a potential volcano. If you are tolerating it means you are holding on.</P>
<P>Acceptance is also negative. You accept that which is not lovable.</P>

<P>This is our company. The Self-Assurance Company. It is only the Self that is always assuring. Nothing else.</P>
<P>Tolerance and acceptance come with judgment and separation. These words which are used, tolerance and acceptance are thought to be positive. I say they are not.</P>
<P>Question: But aren't we supposed to accept people as they are?</P>

      <P>Organization is control. Devotion is chaos!</P>
      <P>Organization needs attention to details, a material awareness. Organization is being worldly.</P>
      <P>Devotion is getting lost, forgetting the world, being in ecstasy.</P>
      <P>These are opposite in nature. They don't go together, yet they cannot be apart or exist without each other. No organization can arise without devotion. When there is so much devotion, you simply want to organize. Devotion brings faith, compassion, and responsibility. With responsibility and caring, you want to give knowledge, wisdom, and love. Then organization happens. So organization exists through devotion.</P>
      <P>If you are devoted, you won't just sit. The nature of devotion is to give. If you think you are devoted and you are not caring for the world, then you are merely selfish. Real devotion means being one with the Divine, and the Divine cares for the world.</P>
      <P>Often you lose devotion in organizing. And often in the name of devotion you create chaos and disregard the organization. You have to be a saint to be both in organization and devotion. If you have both, you are on the mark. So . . .</P>
      <P>Get lost and be guided!</P> 		</font>

      <P>Blessed are those who don't see a mistake as a mistake....!!!</P>
      <P>But it is hard not to see your own mistake. Outwardly you may justify yourself or prove your innocence to someone else, but a mistake pricks a conscience. Do not justify yourself. Instead, feel the prick of the mistake. That very pinch will take you out of the mistake. </P>
      <P>A mistake means something that brings misery to you in the long run. So why would someone knowingly commit a mistake?</P>
      <P>While pointing out a mistake to someone, do you consider him as separate from you and go on pointing out his error or do you make him feel a part of you? When you point out a mistake to someone, does it make him more stressed, or does it create more awareness in that person? Often you do not point out someone's mistake when it is required. Not pointing out a mistake -- with due consideration to time and place -- is also a mistake.</P>
      <P>When you make a new mistake, it is not a mistake; you have learned a valuable lesson. But when you keep doing the same mistake over and over, it is a <B>BIG</B> mistake. A mistake simply means you have missed taking a lesson that has come your way.</P>
      <P>Do not lament over your mistake. Just take the lesson from it. You will not be judged by your mistakes, but by your virtues. Mistakes are of the earth. Virtues are of the Divine.</P>
      <B><P>Wise is the one who learns from other's mistakes.</P>
      <P>Less wise is the one who learns from his own mistakes.</P>
      <P>The fool keeps making the same mistakes again and again and never learns from them.</P>

Here, as in the old days, there is only the empty seat of the Deity, which signifies the divine beyond form. The Indonesian Director of Religious Affairs and a member of the Ministry of Education welcomed Sri Sri at the opening of our Jakarta Ashram. In an inaugural speech, they said they believed Sri Sri's visit would influence the economic crisis in Indonesia. The very next day, the Indonesian currency (Rupiah) was 30% stronger. The devotees from Jakarta have adopted an orphanage in Puncak, which they visit regularly. The director of the orphanage said that while other people bring money, clothes and toys, our group had supplied the missing nutrient the children needed the most : love! The children each received a package of school supplies and goodies. We all laughed, sang and danced as the director cried tears of gratitude. The entourage moved to Singapore where more than 1,000 people welcomed Sri Sri at the packed SLF Auditorium. The evening commenced with a traditional Chinese lion dance; later Sri Sri gave practical points on "Awakening the Beauty Within You."</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER">Cordiality Is One's Nature</P>

    <P>You cannot eliminate formality in society. It has to be given its place. But devoid of cordiality, formality can be hypocritical. Cordiality alone may cause chaos and may even appear sometimes to be uncaring.</P>
<P>Formality improves communication; cordiality improves communion - oneness. Communication is only necessary where there are two. Formality maintains duality.</P>
<P>Structures are based on formality. Love and knowledge are based on cordiality. For love and knowledge to blossom, you need an informal, cordial environment.</P>
<P>An organization cannot happen, orderliness cannot prevail, if the formalities are abandoned.</P>
<P>All actions are measured steps of formality. Devotion is informal and totally chaotic.</P>
<P>Cordiality is the core of one's existence, formality is the outer shell. When the outer shell is thin, it can reflect the inner light. Like the dome of the lamp softens the light. But if the dome is too opaque, you cannot see the light. So, we need to strike a balance between cordial formality and formal cordiality.</P>

      <P>And they all rejoiced for having regained the tenth.</P>
      <P>Similarly the five senses and the four inner faculties (mind, intellect, memory, ego) all lament when they lose sight of the Self. Then the Master comes and shows you that You are the tenth! Count, but never stop until you find the tenth. The joy is in finding the Ever Present.</P>

If you do not try to impress, expression comes naturally. When you come from the self, your expression is perfect and your impression lasts for ages.</P>
        <P>Often you don't seem to have a control over your impressions and expressions. Wisdom is selecting your impressions and expressions. Enlightenment is when you do not take any impressions at all, whether good or bad. Then you "master" the art of expression. Many impressions in the mind cause:</P>
        <P>- Confusion</P>
        <P>- Distraction</P>

        <P>Nature has inbuilt in us a system through which it releases some of the impressions - through dreams, and through meditation.</P>

The last days, Satsang was graced by the Saints from the neighbouring Ashrams. From Rishikesh, Guruji and the entourage left for Chandigarh. The trip was full of Sri Sri's mischief. On the way, the entourage stopped at the Sikh holy shrine - Paonta Sahib. An enthusiastic Chadigarh team received the entourage past midnight.

        <I><P>Kutarka</I> is wrong logic. Most people apply this logic and get caught up in ignorance. For example : The door is half open means the door is half closed. Therefore, the door is fully open means the door is fully closed! </P>
        <P>Or: God is Love. Love is Blind. Therefore, God is Blind!!!</P>
        <I><P>Tarka</I> is sequential logical understanding; it increases scientific knowledge. When sequential logical understanding changes, then scientific conclusions change. For example: Pesticides and antibiotics were considered to be very useful in the past, and are now proven to be more harmful. In <I>tarka</I>, the paradigm changes.</P>
        <I><P>Vitarka</I> is asking questions to which there are no evident answers....Who am I? Where am I? What do I really want? These philosophically appealing questions bring forth spiritual knowledge, increase your awareness and bring about the blossoming of Consciousness, i.e., <I>Atma Gyan</I> increases.</P>
        <P>The wise know to distinguish between the three. They will not apply <I>kutarka</I> or <I>tarka</I> for <I>vitarka, </I>and <I>vitarka</I> for <I>tarka</I>.</P>

<P>The people who are soft out of lack of courage suffer a lot. And sometime or other they become volatile.</P>
<P>Similarly there are two types of forcefulness in people Ö aggression or assertiveness. Some people are forceful in an aggressive manner out of weakness, lack of strength, or out of fear. Others are forceful out of care and love, out of compassion.</P>
<P>David: Aggressive control and aggressive support.</P>

So, all decision-makers are confused! (Laughter)</P>
      <P>Action is spontaneous when there is no actor. In you, there is an actor and there is a witness. An actor is either confused or decisive, but the witness realizes that the action is spontaneous and smiles.</P>
      <P>The more decisions you make, the more confused you are, and as a result you swing between pain and pleasure. The more the witness grows in you, the more playful and untouched you are. Trust, faith, love and joy all manifest in and around you.</P>
      <P>Are you confused, decided or happy now?</P>
      <P>Eberhard: Confusion is too strong of an expression. Is it not rather "choice"?</P>
      <P>Urmila: We are decided that choice is confusion. (Everyone laughs)</P>

      <P>Faith is a wealth. If you think, by having faith in God you are doing a favour to God, you are mistaken. Faith gives you strength instantaneously. Faith brings you stability, centeredness, calmness and love. You having Faith In The Guru Or God, Does Not Do Anything To Guru Or God. Your Having Faith Gives You Immediate Strength. Faith is a great wealth; it is a blessing.</P>
      <P>If you lack faith, you have to pray for faith. But to pray, you need faith. This is a paradox. (Laughter)</P>
      <P>People have faith in the world - but the whole world is just a soap bubble. People have faith in themselves - but they don't know who they are. People think that they have faith in God - but they have no idea of God. If you want to doubt, you have to doubt everything</P>
      <P>There are three types of faith : faith in yourself, faith in the world, and faith in God. You need to have faith in yourself -- without faith, you think, I can't do this. This is not for me. I will never be liberated in this life. You must have faith in the world. Without this, you cant move an inch in the world. Banks give you loans having faith that you will pay it back. You deposit money in the bank having faith that it will be returned. If you doubt everything in the world, nothing will happen. The same is the case with faith in the Divine - have faith in the Divine and you will evolve. All these faiths are connected. You must have all three for each to be strong.</P>
      <P>Bill : Atheists have faith in themselves and faith in the world, but not in God.</P>
      <P>Sri Sri : They don't have complete faith in themselves. Lack of faith in God, in the world or in the self brings fear. Faith in the world cannot be constant because there are always changes.</P>
      <P>Faith makes you full - faithful. If you have faith, you are full. </P>
      <P>Rajesh : What is the difference between faith and confidence ? </P>
      <P>Sri Sri : Confidence is the result. Faith is the beginning. </P>
      <P>Faith in yourself brings freedom.</P>
      <P>Faith in the world brings you peace of mind.</P>
      <P>Faith in God evokes love in you.</P>
      <P>You can be at peace by having faith in the world and without faith in God, but it is not complete peace. If you have love, there is automatically peace and freedom. People who are extremely disturbed should only have faith in God.</P> 		</font>

After several bhajans, Guruji started chanting. Suddenly people started pointing into the western sky where a huge thundercloud appeared, the top of which was filled with brilliant colours of unusual intensity. The trees had been crying for water and within a few minutes, the wind started and it began to rain. What was it? It was not a rainbow. We contacted the weather observatory, but they had no idea of this phenomenon. When we asked the explanation for this, Guruji said, "Nature is our friend".</P>
      <P>Miscellaneous Newsplashes - After hectic activities in Bangalore, Guruji tried to escape to Mangalore for 24 hours but it turned out to be another party. Art of Living representatives, headed by Sharada Lavingia were invited to the G -8 Summit reception in Birmingham, U.K. Art of Living was also represented in the World Health Organisation Conference in Geneva, Switzerland. Teachers presented programmes in St. Petersburg, Russia. Women's prison programs have started in Bangalore. Reports of more seva projects are arriving from all over the world.</P>

<P>You wake up first. God is still asleep. When you wake up first, you experience pain and pleasure. You become aware of the shortcomings of the world and its beauty. Then you cry for help and seek the ultimate and then you wake up God. And when God is awakened in you, there is no "two." </P>
<P>When both God and you are asleep, there is inertia. When the "I" is asleep, there is no experience. </P>
<P>God is in you in seed form. When he wakes up, you cease to exist. God is asleep in every particle in this universe. It's you who wakes up first and then you awaken God. And when God wakes up, neither you nor the world remain.</P>
<P>The rishis made a mockery. They created a practice of awakening God every morning. They call it Suprabhatam service. Many find this ridiculous because they don't understand the depth of it. Only awakened God can see that God is asleep everywhere. [Laughter.] </P>
<P>Brinda: Why should we wake up?</P>
<P>Sri Sri: Because you are not asleep. If you were asleep, how can you ask the question?</P>
<P>Bill: Once you are awake, can you go back to sleep? </P>
<P>Sri Sri: If you have not had tea, of course.</P>
<P>Bill: Who wakes us up?</P>
<P>Sri Sri: You figure that out.</P> 		</font>

  		<B><P>NEWSFLASH!</B> A tree planting program was begun at the Bangalore ashram. Guruji met with villagers and inaugurated the 4-H program: health, hygiene, home and human values. Satsang groups were started in the villages around the ashram. Guruji travelled from Bangalore to Bombay which was covered with big billboards. The city Satsang attracted over 5,000. When Guruji and entourage arrived at the airport for the trip to Mauritius, we were told the flight was overbooked and we would have to take a later flight. Guruji showed his "Guru card" and suddenly everything worked and all seven travellers had seats on the plane. </P>
<P>Then on to Mauritius where the volunteers did a wonderful job organising many events: interviews with television and radio, two Satsangs, a lecture at the University, audiences with the president and prime minister, and a visit to an old age home (attended by the Minister of Health and Minister of Women). The local Art of Living society has adopted the old age home as a seva project. During his last visit to Mauritius, Guruji captured the police, and this time he met with wardens and other prison officials. Vikram recorded the Seeds of Wisdom at a local radio station, which will broadcast one quote each day for the next month.</P>
<P>This ends the third year of Weekly Knowledge. </P>
<P>Homework for next week: Everyone individually or in their Satsang groups should write the Knowledge for next week and e-mail it to Bill and Anne at stillpoint@erols.com or fax to 301-854-0080.</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>BEYOND THE RATIONAL MIND: BREAKING THE BARRIER</B></P>
      
      <P>We Usually Do Only That Which Is Purposeful, Useful, And Rational. Everything You See, You See Through The rational mind. But an intuition, a discovery, new knowledge goes beyond the rational mind. Truth is beyond the rational mind. </P>
      <P>The rational mind is like a railroad track that is fixed in grooves. A plane has no tracks. It can fly anywhere. A balloon can float anywhere.</P>
      <P>Some people step out of the rational mind in order to rebel against society. They want to break social law but for the ego's sake. They do it out of anger, hatred, rebelliousness, and wanting attention. This is not stepping out of the rational mind (though they think it is).</P>
      <P>We step out of the rational mind when we do something that has no purpose. Accepting that, as an act, makes it a game. Life becomes lighter. If you are stuck with only rational acts, life becomes a burden. Suppose you play a game without a thought to winning or losing, just act irrationally. Making an act without any purpose attached to it - it is freedom - like a dance. </P>
      <P>So just step out of the rational mind and you will  find a greater freedom, an unfathomable depth, and you willl come face to face with reality. Reality transcends logic and the rational mind. Until you transcend the rational mind you will not get access to creativity and the infinite.</P>
      <P>But if you do an irrational act in order to find freedom, then it already has a purpose and a meaning. It is no longer irrational. This knowledge sheet has already spoiled it's own possibility.</P>
      <P>Break the barrier of the rational mind and then find freedom for yourself. </P> 		</font>

From Botswana where Sri Sri's talk made headlines in the newspapers, to Johannesburg and Durban where the Symposium on Human Values was attended by senior government officials and prominent religious leaders, the African tour has left crowds reeling. The Premier of the Kwa-Zulu Natal province offered to organize courses in the local prisons. The International Association for Human Values 1998 Award for promoting human values was awarded to President Nelson Mandela. Sri Sri moved on to enthusiastic crowds in Atlanta and New York. Tomorrow he will address the Values Caucus at the United Nations. </P>

After the talk in New Jersey it was on to Pittsburgh where Guruji enjoyed a university professor who came to disrupt the meeting and to heckle, but who only added more charm.</P>

      <P>When You Feel Stuck In Life And Not Growing, Bombarded By Desires, When There Is Dryness, Lack Of enthusiasm, no juice, what do you do?</P>
<P>Here is the solution....FEEL GENEROUS....right away, not tomorrow. </P>
<P>Either a princess or a pauper can feel generous. Generosity is the quality of the spirit. When you feel generous your life becomes abundant, full of compassion and love.</P>
<P>Question: Is generosity the same as being grateful?</P>
<P>Answer: No. Gratefulness always has self concern. You are grateful because you have something or you get something. Generosity is an expression independent of external circumstances. No one can make you feel generous. That is something that you have to do yourself. Essentially, generosity is not an act. It is a state of consciousness, but it cannot but find its expression in an act.</P>
<P>Question: What about passion?</P>
<P>Answer: Passion indicates scarcity. Dispassion is abundance. Dispassion without generosity makes you self-centered, causes more dryness.</P>
<P>You dont´ have to think about what you have done in the past. That only brings doership.</P>
<P>Just feel generous. </P>

      <P>Krishna tells Arjuna, "You are very dear to me."</P>

      <P>assumption. First you must assume. You assume you are the most beloved of the</P>
      <P>Divine, and then surrender happens.</P>
      <P>Surrender is not an action; it is an assumption. Non-surrender is</P>
      <P>ignorance. Non-surrender is an illusion. So surrender is an assumption.</P>
      <P>Surrender has to begin as an assumption and then it reveals itself as a</P>
      <P>reality. Finally, it reveals itself as an illusion. An illusion because there</P>
      <P>is no two, no duality. </P>
      <P>There is no independent existence of anyone. An individual has no</P>
      <P>independent existence. That is it!</P>
      <P>Question: Do you have to go through surrender to realize it is an illusion?</P>
      <P>Answer: Yes, absolutely.</P>
      <P>Question: Where is choice then?</P>
      <P>Answer: Choice is your destiny.</P>
      <P>Krishna doesn't tell Arjuna in the beginning that he must surrender. First</P>
      <P>he says, "You are so dear to me." And then he tells him, " There is no other</P>
      <P>choice for you, you must surrender. Either you do it now, or you do it later."</P>

Not enjoying the bliss or the peace takes you further - otherwise the bliss or the peace can create cravings. If the existence wants to give it, then fine. It takes courage to say "I am". Your true nature is bliss. But trying to enjoy the bliss, you step down from is-ness to am-ness - "l am peaceful", "I am blissful". And that is followed by "I am miserable". "l am" is dispassion. You can be anywhere and be dispassionate. Dispassion is welcoming everything. Centeredness brings energy, a spark. Enjoyment of bliss brings inertia. If you are dispassionate, the bliss is still there. When the freezer is full of ice cream you do not bother about it. Dispassion takes away the sense of scarcity. Passion is a sense of lack of abundance. And whenever everything is abundance, dispassion happens. And when dispassion is there, everything comes in abundance. </P>
      <P>Q: What do we do when we catch ourselves enjoying our bliss?</P>
      <P>Guruji: Then we feel stupid. Just an understanding we are enjoying it, creates a shift. There is no effort. Knowledge is better than action to make you free.</P>

You have mercy on those who you think are not yours. Mercy indicates anger, judgment and authority. When you ask for mercy, you are self- centered. You want to be excused from the law of cause and effect. It also indicates lack of courage and valor.</P>
<P>At times mercy is an impediment to growth. Mercy, of course, brings some comfort and relief; but can impair the process of transformation. If the leaves were to ask for mercy from falling, they would not be transformed. </P>
<P>If someone is driving and is tired, they will stop at the rest area. But if they start living there, they will be arrested (laughter). Then the spot has not served its purpose.</P>

<P>When you know and trust the process of creation, you will simply rejoice. It is the small mind which superimposes its nature on the Divine mind. Only when you made a mistake and you think God is angry and judging you do you ever ask for mercy. The Divine is all knowing and all loving; there is no chance for mercy. </P>
<P>Do you know I have no mercy? When there is intimacy there is no place for mercy.</P>

      <P align="justify"> Ottawa, Canada's capital, was graced with the Master's presence 
        for two action-packed days this past week, where his public talk on Human Values 
        at the elegant Chateau Laurier made the TV evening news, and the Hindu Temple 
        experienced a tidal wave of joy and bliss. Then our caravan moved on to the 
        advanced course at the Montreal Ashram, where we set new attendance records 
        with 450 course participants. All are amazed at how smoothly things have gone, 
        and there is no question that this is all due to the Guru's grace. A group of 
        devotees from Central America has everyone dancing at the lively satsangs this 
        week in our spacious and colourful tent by the lake. Nature has cooperated by 
        providing perfect weather all week, and no bugs! Everyone is happy amidst great 
        celebration. Fireworks at the lake on Thursday night will mark the grand finale 
        of the North American summer tour, as Guruji prepares to leave for Germany.

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>LOYALTY</B></P>
      
      <P align="justify">Loyalty is the way in which a mature and integrated mind behaves. 
        Loyalty indicates undivided wholeness of consciousness and shows richness of 
        the mind. When the mind is not integrated it is feverish, disloyal and opportunistic. 
        Disloyalty comes out of opportunism. Opportunism is short-sightedness of one's 
        destiny. Integrity or wholeness is essential to be healthy. A divided mind will 
        gradually lead to schizophrenia and other physical and mental disorders. Loyalty 
        is a real strength and will have the support of nature in the long run.</P>
      <P align="justify">Fear and ambitions are impediments to loyalty. Loyalty is needed 
        both in the material and spiritual plane. Either to destroy, create or maintain 
        any institution, group or society, loyalty is essential.</P>
      <P align="justify">Loyalty means believing in the continuity of commitment. Honouring 
        commitment is loyalty. It takes you beyond the duality of craving and aversion.</P>
      <P align="justify">Responsibility, dedication, commitment are the limbs of loyalty. 
      </P>
      <P align="justify">A loyal mind is a 'yes'-mind. The purpose of asking questions 
        is to get an answer. The purpose of all answers is to create a ...'yes'.... 
        'Yes' is an acknowledgement of knowledge. The 'yes'-mind is a quiet, holistic 
        and joyful mind. The 'no'-mind is a agitated, doubting and miserable mind. Loyalty 
        begins with a 'yes'-mind and starts to perish with a 'no'-mind. </P>

      <P align="justify">Why do you love someone? Is it because of their qualities or 
        is it because of a sense of kinship or intimacy?</P>
      <P align="justify">You can love someone for their qualities and not feel a sense 
        of kinship. This type of love gives rise to competition and jealousy. Such is 
        not the case when love arises out of kinship.</P>
      <P align="justify">If you love someone for their qualities, then when the quality 
        changes or you get used to the quality, love also changes. However, if you love 
        someone out of kinship, because they belong to you, then that love remains for 
        life-times.</P>
      <P align="justify">People say "I love God, because He is great". This is no big 
        thing. If God is found to be ordinary, just one of us, then your love for God 
        collapses! If you love God, because He is yours, then however God is, whether 
        He creates or destroys, you still love Him. The love for kinship is like the 
        love for yourself.</P>

      If love is based on the quality of a person, then the love is not stable - after 
      sometime the qualities change and the love becomes shaky. Loving someone because 
      of their greatness or uniqueness is Third-rate love. Loving someone because they 
      belong to you, great or otherwise, is unconditional love.
      <P align="justify">Knowledge, Sadhana, Seva and Satsang help to bring about a 
        sense of belonging in no time. When love springs forth from a sense of belongingness 
        then the actions and qualities do not over shadow the love. Neither the qualities 
        nor actions can be perfect all the time. Love and a feeling of kinship alone 
        can be perfect.</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>SINGING, COMMUNICATION AND EGO</B></P>
      
      <P align="justify">There are three modes of communication: in head to head communication 
        you talk, in heart to heart communication you sing, and soul to soul communication 
        happens in silence.</P>
      <P align="justify">When you meet with people, often you communicate from head 
        to head. When you are with nature, you start singing, you communicate with nature 
        from your heart. Often when you are with people you keep talking, blabbering, 
        and you keep the communication on the level of the head only. But when you are 
        with nature, you start humming and your communication comes through the heart. 
        And when you are with the guru, you go blank and forget all the questions. Then 
        communication comes through the soul in silence.</P>
      <P align="justify">When you meet with people, you like to remain in the head, 
        you seldom sing with people (other than when it is organised). Your ego obstructs 
        you from singing. Many do not feel comfortable singing with people. When you 
        sing with people then you descend to the heart level or feeling level. Some 
        feel comfortable just listening to music. Some feel comfortable singing only 
        when they are alone. Some sing to draw attention or to charm others. Some only 
        want to join in when all the others are singing. All this singing comes from 
        ego. </P>
      <P align="justify">Bhajan means sharing, sharing from the deepest level of our 
        existence. Bhajan is authentic sharing. If you could sing with people, then 
        your ego shatters. Children can sing with people for they do not have ego. To 
        sing with a stranger you have to be free of ego. Ego doesn't let you sing with 
        a stranger. Head level is safe for the ego -heart level breaks the ego - soul 
        level dissolves the ego. All communication gaps happen because of ego.</P>
      <P align="justify">Exercise: when you are with people, rather then chatting just 
        start singing and you can feel the shift of energy that is happening. If you 
        want to have more fun, greet a stranger with a song. </P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>EXPANSION OF CONSCIOUSNESS IS PEACE</B></P>
      
      <P align="justify">Consciousness moving on the surface of the body is stimuli, 
        which cause pleasure. When consciousness shrinks, then the sensation of pain 
        and suffering arises. Suffering is the shrinking or contraction of consciousness.</P>
      <P align="justify">When consciousness moves through the body in limited channels, 
        pleasure is experienced. Repeated enjoyment of the stimuli causes inertia and 
        dullness. Often cooks don't enjoy their own food. Listening to the same piece 
        of music loses the charm, people in the sex industry don't enjoy sex. If the 
        stimuli are observed, then consciousness expands and becomes peace. With awareness 
        the stimuli lose their significance; whether they exist or not makes no difference. 
        When the sun is there, then whether the candle is lit or not makes no difference. 
        To realise that all pleasures are just stimuli and that you are more than the 
        stimuli brings freedom.</P>
      <P align="justify">Pain is nothing but consciousness wanting to expand and to 
        become free. Freedom basically is liberation from the craving of the stimuli. 
        Pain is not a permanent state. The natural tendency of consciousness is to expand, 
        to become bliss. Like the natural tendency of water is to flow downward, and 
        the natural tendency of air is not to be under pressure, the natural tendency 
        of consciousness is to expand and to be at peace. Like the person who is an 
        insomniac and has forgotten how to sleep, most of us have forgotten to be at 
        peace and in bliss.</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>DEPENDENCE, INDEPENDENCE, INTERDEPENDENCE AND ONENESS</B></P>
      
      <P align="justify">The body is dependent on the whole creation. In society, somebody 
        has to make clothes, produce electricity, drill for oil. The body cannot be 
        independent of the world. For the body, dependency is absolute. When the Spirit 
        identifies with the body, then it gets pinched and looks for independence. Mind, 
        intellect, ego - they all look for independence.</P>
      <P align="justify">In looking for independence often you get stuck in the ego 
        and become more miserable. Most people are not aware of their dependency. When 
        they become aware of their limitations and dependency, the desire for independence 
        arises. Independence cannot be achieved unless you start moving from within. 
        When you move within, you discover that you are interdependent. Individual Self/Soul/Jeeva 
        is interdependence and in fact every wise person knows that everything is interdependent 
        and that there is nothing like independence. </P>
      <P align="justify">On one level dependency is a harsh reality. On another level, 
        it is an illusion because there is nothing else but the Self. It's only when 
        you don't feel oneness, belongingness that you want independence. The Self being 
        non-dual, there is no question of dependence or independence. One who asks for 
        independence is a beggar. One who knows that it is an illusion is a King. When 
        the sense of belongingness is not well founded, then there is a volatile state 
        in the life of a seeker. Then the ego finds some excuse to revert to smallness. 
        It is not yet totally soaked in the totality of knowledge. As it is not used 
        to it, the mind finds every little excuse to revert back to the ego and to be 
        aloof and independent and separate and it would find any small fault and blow 
        it out of proportion. Be aware of these tendencies and come what may, be strong 
        in the commitment to the Satsang, the Path. </P>

      <P align="justify">Activity and rest are two vital aspects of life. To find a 
        balance in them is a skill in itself. When to have what and how much to have 
        is wisdom. Finding them in each other-activity in rest and rest in activity-is 
        the ultimate freedom. </P>
      <P align="justify">More tiring than the work itself is the memory of hard work. 
        Thinking you have worked hard itself interferes with the quality of rest. Some 
        people take pride in working hard without any results. And there are others 
        who crave for long rest not knowing the rest is in non-doership. It is the quality 
        of rest, even if it is short, that recuperates. </P>
      <P align="justify">When rest is needed, your body will automatically take it. 
        Resting, without thinking about the need for it, is more restful. Desirelessness, 
        Dispassion, and Samadhi are the deepest rest.</P>

        arrived at the Ashram on a full moon day and launched the paddle boat on the

        tiring nor frustrating. For example, daily routines like brushing one's teeth 
        or bathing are not even considered actions because they are so integrated into 
        one's life. You do all this without doership. When Seva is made part of your

        The Mayor of Guwahati, who recently did the course, actively assists the Seva 
        teams in their drive to clean the city. Seventeen boulevards in Calcutta have 
        been adopted by the chapter under the 5-H program. Enthusiastic volunteers carried 
        food, clothes and other necessities for the flood victims of Malda, West Bengal. 
        The advanced course in Junagadh had 500 people and was indescribable. Sri Sri 
        attended 4 to 5 Satsangs each day in different part of the city. Excellent teamwork 
        and arrangements made for a electrifying Satsang in Rajkot with over 7000 people. 
        Guruji made a great escape after tearing the decorations, jumping off a wall, 
        getting into his car without his sandals and driving through fields. The latest 
        news from Bangalore is the advanced course in the Ashram and Guruji's series 
        of talks on the Bhagavad Gita in Kannada language.</P>

      <P align="justify">Wanting to correct a mistake brings doership and doership is 
        the foundation for mistakes. Often, those who are trying to correct mistakes 
        get caught up in more mistakes. Those who recognize their are mistakes are freed 
        from them. </P>
      <P align="justify">Often, when one acknowledges a mistake, one tries to justify 
        it, without taking responsibility for it. And sometimes one accepts that one 
        made a mistake and starts justifying it or feeling guilty about it. Mistakes 
        get dropped when one is troubled by ones conscience (viveka) or grief.</P>
      <P align="justify">There may be flaws in any action, any situation or any person.

      <P align="justify">Guruji is visiting Halifax and surprised the devotees of Halifax. 
        Halifax is far from Montreal and many devotees were unable to come to the ashram

        seed does not allow you to be happy, to smile from your heart, to be loving 
        and loveable. It's there all the time like a thorn - irritating, irritating.</P>

        long walk through the forest after dark. For the flock of devotees following 
        Him, the experience seemed to be a metaphor for the spiritual path following 
        the Guru blindly along a steep and narrow trail, through the pitch black darkness, 
        without any idea of how to find our way, yet laughing merrily anyway.</font></P>

        in fine style with fireworks over the lake, a candlelight procession and the 
        Light of Lights illuminating our hearts. The trees are now nearly bare, but 
        the colorless landscape of late fall is not nearly as bleak as the prospect 
        of Guruji's departure this weekend.</font></P>

        "You have to rejoice in the means. You have to love the means. Love is the goal; 
        the means must also be loveable. Love springs when there is no effort, when 
        all activities are shunned. As long as there is karma - the impression to act, 
        you have to act. When this tendency to act eases up, total effortlessness happens. 
        In effortlessness, unconditional love dawns. And every life is aching for that 
        love."</font></P>

        is unusual,not ordinary, and not their nature. Isn't it so?</P>
      <P align="justify">For example, when a wicked person doesn't create a problem 
        then you appreciate them. Or, when somebody you think is not good does a good 
        act, then you appreciate them. Also, when a good person does something extraordinary, 
        then you appreciate them. If a child made you a cup of tea, you would appreciate 
        it, but if a mother made the same cup of tea, you would not likely appreciate 
        it because it is a normal act for her. In the same way, you appreciate getting 
        a ride from someone you don't know, but you don't necessarily appreciate it 
        from a bus driver.</P>
      <P align="justify">In all these cases, those acts are temporary, out of character, 
        or not their nature. So when you appreciate someone for something, you imply 
        that it is not the way they are usually. </P>

      <P align="justify">You can be at ease with the uncertainty of the world when you 
        realise the certainty of the consciousness. Often people do just the opposite. 
        They are certain about the things in the world and uncertain about God. They 
        rely on something that is not reliable and get upset. Uncertainty causes craving 
        for stability and the most stable thing in the universe is our Self.<br>
      </P>
      <P align="justify">The world is of change, the Self is of non-change. You have 
        to rely on the non-change and accept the change. If you are certain that everything 
        is uncertain, then you are liberated. When you are uncertain in ignorance then 
        you become worried and tense. Uncertainty with awareness brings higher states 
        of consciousness and a smile.</P>
      </FONT> <FONT FACE="Arial"> 
      <P align="justify"> Bharat says: A certain smile!!!</P>
      <P align="justify">Often people think that certainty is freedom. If you feel that 
        freedom when you are not certain then that is 'real' freedom. Often your certainty 
        or uncertainty is based on the relative world. To be certain about the uncertainty 
        of the relative, makes you certain about the existence of the absolute and brings 
        a 'certain' faith in the absolute. Nitin says: Yes, to understand this you certainly 
        need to have awareness!!!</P>

        umbrellas and deepa balikas (girls holding lamps) and the King. Over fifteen 
        thousand people were present and yet there was pindrop silence during meditation. 
        The program was telecast live. Then onto Varkala for a morning satsang enroute 
        to Kanyakumari the southernmost tip of India where the three seas meet. The 
        next day the entire town of Udayankulangara celebrated Guruji's brief stopover

        was making a portrait of Sri Sri for a billboard felt strong currents in his 
        body as he was giving the finishing touches and started crying. He has joined 
        the next Basic course. All the teachers are busy with hundreds taking the course. 
        Throughout Kerala there were arches built welcoming Guruji. Our devotees and

        of Vedic knowledge, where Guruji honored many Vedic pundits and meditations 
        were held in many ancient temples. Then the satsang army marched on to Papanasam, 
        Guruji's birthplace, where everyone played in the water - shooting missiles 
        of bliss. Then on to Trichy for an invigorating satsang. People were well fed 
        up in the temples. In spite of the tour being hectic the whole group of 80 was 
        so energetic and enthusiastic. Guruji was received by the temple authorities 
        at the Sri Rangam temple and honored by the pontiff of the Vaishnava tradition, 
        who was visibly moved. Then the troupe moved on to Madhurai where the elephants 
        garlanded Guruji to the beat of the drums on the premises of the famous Minakshi 
        temple, for a jubilant satsang with more than 8000 people who were spell-bound 
        in a great meditation. Next morning the entire town of Rajapalayam celebrated 
        a long awaited (seven years) satsang with Guruji. Before noon the group left 
        for Udimalpet where many seva projects had been launched. Again a big satsang 
        with several 1000 people. The next morning there was a live kriya and satsang 
        for about 2500 people and the group went to Pollachi for the grand, final satsang 
        of the tour. Then the caravan of buses and cars left for Bangalore and Guruji 
        left for Madras, where a gentlemen came to meet him with an ancient, 5000 year 
        old palm leaf script which mentioned the name of Guruji, and the immense grace 
        that flows through him and protects and transforms the life of millions. Then 
        Guruji came to the European ashram Bad Antogast in Germany. Several advanced

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>BLISS</B></P>
      
      <P>Bliss cannot be understood.  It is extremely difficult to get into bliss.  After many lifetimes you get into bliss. It is even more difficult to get out of bliss.  All that you seek in your life is bliss, that divine union with your source, and everything else in the world distracts you from that goal.  There are a zillion things to distract you from that goal in so many ways.  So many unexplainable, incomprehensible ways of not coming home.</P>

      <P>The mind is kept alive by cravings and aversions - shoulds or should nots and wants.  Only when the mind dies does the bliss dawn.  Bliss is the abode of all divinity, all devas.  It is possible only in this human body to comprehend, to uphold, and having had a human life and having known this path, if you still do not realize this - you are at the greatest loss.  The cravings and aversions make your heart hard.  There is no use in being polite in your behavior. You can be rude in your behavior but you cannot be rough in your heart.  If you are rude in your behavior, it is acceptable, but not if you are rough in your heart.  The world does not care how you are inside.  It only looks to your behavior.  The Divine does not care how you are outside - It only looks to your inside.  Never let any tiny bit of dislike or craving house in your heart.  Let it be fresh, soft and fragrant like a rose.</P>
      
      <P>It is such an illusion - you dislike someone or something, and this only makes you hard and your hardness takes a long time to soften, to disappear.  It is such a trap for keeping you away from the treasure.  Nothing in this material world can give you contentment.  An outer-looking mind seeking for contentment gets discontented and the discontentment grows, and complaints and negativity start hardening the brain, clouding the awareness (the aura), and forming a huge cloud of negative energy.  When the negativity reaches its peak, like an overloaded balloon, it bursts and comes back to the Divinity.  You can never escape the Divine, the long route of negativity, or the instantaneous positive approach.  When the Divinity dawns, in no time the shift happens from the untruth to truth, from darkness to light, from the dull inert matter to the sparkling spirit.  When the heart is hard, there is no fun.  You cannot experience fun.</P> 		</font>

<P>NEWS FLASH</P>

</B><P>The Poland  Art of Living distributed 76,000 kgs of milk powder to homeless children.  Russia reports that the Art of Living course is now a part of the curriculum at the University of Irkutsk in Siberia, Russia.  Guruji's tour of the Netherlands began with a noontime talk at the University of Maastricht to an overcrowded hall with no room to even stand.  The group continued to Amsterdam, where he gave a great talk on Human Values to 140 diplomats, ministers and ambassadors representing 20 countries.  The next evening, a public talk was held in a beautifully decorated hall with melodious music and marvelous meditation and everyone was in bliss.  There was an art exhibit on Human Values and the atmosphere was filled with joy and enthusiasm.  The group then moved on to Rotterdam, where Guruji completed the tour with a talk to the Indian community and everyone present was shining as brightly as decorations.</P>

      <P>Do you welcome all that comes to you or do you resist it? If you cannot resist anything, you cannot welcome anything!   You cannot resist everything and you cannot welcome everything!</P>

      <P>You don't welcome all thoughts that come to your mind.  When you welcome a thought, it means you find it good and act on it.  If you act on all thoughts that come to your mind, you will end up in a mental hospital or in prison.  So, you resist or ignore some thoughts and welcome other thoughts.  You need discrimination in life.  Welcoming and resisting is a swing in life.</P>
      
      <P>Welcoming is essential for expansion and growth, and resistance is essential for maintenance.</P>
      
      <P>Audience:  But what you resist persists!</P>
      
      <P>Guruji:  If you resist a cold it does not persist!  If there is no resistance in your body you cannot survive.  Your body resists something and welcomes something.</P>
      
      <P>Where the resistance is weak, the persistence happens.  A weak resistance makes the opposition persist.  A strong resistance erases the opposition.  Strong resistance leads to valour, power and samadhi (equanimity).  It brings in you the strength of a warrior. Nothing can tempt you, nothing can obstruct you.   Then the victory is gained without fighting.  Where there is strong resistance or total welcome, the victory is gained without any fighting.</P> 		</font>

      <P>  When a part of the body is stimulated, pleasure arises.  When your soul is stimulated, love arises. Love has no end but pleasure ends.  Often people think pleasure is love.  Distinction between pleasure and love has to be understood, only the luckiest one will understand.</P>

      <P>Like you eat sugar and stimulate the tongue, music stimulates the ears and sight stimulates the eyes.  And what stimulates the soul?  Sadhana and Satsang is what stimulates the soul!</P>
      
      <P>All that one wants is the stimulation of the soul.  Even a faint idea of it keeps life going.  Every other stimulus is on the surface.  The stimulus of the soul energizes and the stimulus of the body brings tiredness.  Every stimulus should lead you to the self so that when you listen to music, you transcend the music, and when you listen to Knowledge it takes you to the Silence.  </P> 		</font>

      <P align="justify">I chant the name of my beloved in every breath. The beloved 
        is faultless - perfect. But being in love I have lost my reputation.When there 
        is so much love, you take total responsibility for any misunderstanding. You 
        may express dismay for a moment on the surface. But when you do not feel that 
        in your heart, you arrive at a perfect understanding. You are in a state where 
        all problems and differences slide away and only love shines through. </P>
      <P align="justify">Usually we get stuck in our differences, because we have lost 
        sight of ourselves. In the name of love we try to manipulate and control the 
        other person. This is natural that when we love somebody, we want them to be 
        perfect. </P>
      <P align="justify">You can never see the pits in the ground from the top of a 
        hill. From a plane the earth looks so smooth. So also from a state of elevated 
        consciousness, you do not see the pitfalls in others. But if you come to the 
        ground you always see the holes. And when you want to fill the holes, you have 
        to see them. You cannot build a home being airborne. You cannot till the land 
        without looking at the pits, filling them, removing the pebbles....</P>
      <P align="justify">That is why when you love somebody you find all the faults 
        in them. But finding faults destroys love. Instead of filling the pits we run 
        away from them. When you love somebody and see their faults, stay with them 
        and help them fill the pits. This is wisdom.</P>

        dominates, Self-awareness will be at its lowest, and that's why all the philosophers 
        around the world have always advocated renunciation and dropping of desires. 
        When the awareness is dominant, then happiness dawns. When desire dominates, 
        stress and sorrow result. When actions dominates, restlessness and disease is 
        the result. When your actions and desires are sincerely directed to the Divine

        violent or angry. They think it is prestigious or a status symbol to be aggressive. 
        Aggression is not thought to be a quality to be ashamed of. This promotes aggression 
        and violence in the whole society, and when aggression and violence are promoted,

        have to be acting or putting out effort, know that life is short. When you are 
        expecting a result, then you are often frustrated. The ignorant person does 
        it the other way: He hurries for the result and is impatient. Impatience goes 
        away when you know that life is eternal. When you are looking for a return of 
        a favor from someone or a result from your good deed, you want it quickly. When 
        you realize life is short, procrastination falls away. But when you know that 
        there are many lifetimes, you realize that if you don't get it sooner, you get 
        it later. Wake up and see your life is too short. Time is running so what are 
        you doing with your life? Is it being useful to you and the world around you? 
        Realize life is too short. WAKE UP! LIFE IS ETERNAL!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial"><br>
        </font><font face="Arial">When you want to enjoy the fruit of action know that 
        life is eternal. When it comes to hope, you should know that there are many 
        lifetimes. When you are looking for results, know that time is eternal. If someone 
        doesn't thank you or takes advantage of you, thank them because they will pay 
        you back later with interest. So no one needs to feel sorry that they have been 
        taken advantage of or unappreciated. Know that they will have to be paying you 
        back in the future with interest! When it comes to enjoying the fruit of your 
        actions, good deeds or even blessings, know that life is eternal. Anytime that 
        you are in a hurry, you cannot enjoy. So know that life is eternal.</font> </p>

        cannot. And you cannot rest when you feel you have to be someone whom you are 
        not. You are not required to do what you cannot. You will not be asked to give 
        what you cannot give. Nothing is expected of you that you cannot do. Doing service

        will burn inside.</font></p>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>FAITH: A QUALITY OF UNDIVIDED CONSCIOUSNESS</B></P>
      
      <P>That in which you have faith, do not make it an object of knowing.  Faith is the nature of undivided mind, undivided consciousness.  We have faith in God, do not try to know God.   We have faith in Self, do not try to know Self. You can't have faith in that which you make an object of knowing.  A thing to know is an object of knowing.  You have made it into an object of knowing.  Whatever you have faith in, you do not need to know about it.  Do not make that something you have faith in, an object of knowing.  Like you have faith in God, you cannot make God an object of knowing; like you have faith in yourself, you can't make the Self an object of knowing.<BR>
        <BR>
        Q. Are faith and belief the same?<BR>
        Guruji: Belief is a little diluted, faith is little strong, more concrete.   Our beliefs can change, faith is firm.  Faith is yogurt, belief is buttermilk. (Laughter....)<BR>
        </P>
        <P>Like a child has faith in the mother, the child does not make the mother into an object of knowing.  The child does not try to know the mother, it simply has faith in the mother.  When you have faith, what is the need to know it?  You cannot make love an object of knowing, if you try to make love an object of knowing, if you try to know it, it will disappear.<BR>
        <BR>
        In the same way you cannot make Self, or God an object of knowing.  God, love, sleep, and Self are beyond knowing.  If you try to analyze, doubt comes in and faith will disappear.  So whatever you want to have faith in, do not want to know it or analyze it.  The moment you make something an object of knowing then analysis starts and then doubt follows.  Analysis creates a distance, synthesis brings it together.  Faith is synthesis, knowing is analysis.<BR>
        <BR>
        Barbara: Can you have faith without being aware of it?<BR>
        Guruji: Yes. You have faith.  Consciousness cannot exist without faith.  Faith is a relaxed, stable, quality of consciousness.  It is like the flame of a candle.  The nature of consciousness is faith.<BR>
        <BR>
        Theologians analyze too much.  They study 5 to 6 years and then they lose their faith.<BR>
        </P>
        <P>A story: Jyoti once met an officer in-charge of religious affairs.  The minister was so sure that no one can have spiritual experiences.  She gave him a short talk on spirituality and she concluded by saying,  &quot;I believe in what I experience."  His comment was, &quot;I am glad to hear that you too are an <BR>
        atheist!&quot;  Another ANALYSIS by a theologian has recently concluded that Jesus never existed.<BR>
        <BR>
        Nick: Does God have faith in us?<BR>
        Guruji: I don't know?!! (Laughter - very non-analytical!!) To know whether God has faith or not, you have to analyze.  If you ask whether God has faith in us then you give God also a mind, which is not true.<BR>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>SUCCESS</B></P>
      
      <P>Q.: How was yesterday's program? Was it successful?</P>

      <P>Guruji: There is no question of success if you have nothing to gain. There is nothing to gain if you have only come to give and serve.  Success indicates non-supremacy. Success means what?  It indicates that there are chances of failure.  If something is supreme there is nothing to lose.  People running after success only exhibit their limitations.</P>
      
      <P>Success means crossing a limit.  To cross a limit you need to assume that you have a limit.  Assuming a limit is underestimating yourself.  If you have no boundaries then where is your success?  If you have limitless access then there is no success.  You don't say that you successfully drank a glass of water, because it is well within your capabilities.  But when you do something that is beyond your perceived limits you claim success. </P>
      
      <P>When you realise your unboundedness then no action is an achievement.  </P>
      
      <P>Anyone who claims to be successful only reveals his limitation.  If you feel very successful it means that you have underestimated yourself.  All your gains can only be smaller than you.  Taking pride in any gains is belittling yourself. </P>
      
      <P>Sheila: What if you feel that you are not serving successfully?</P>
      
      <P>Guruji: You may feel that you have not done enough but you will not feel that you have not been successful.  Real service is when you feel that you have not done enough.</P>
      
      <P>Kai: You are not very successful! (Laughter)</P>

      <P>Question:  Guruji, what is your message?</P>

      <P>Guruji:  I have no message.  In order to give a message you have to be far away.  Message needs a distance.  Message is of  the past or of the future.  Message is impersonal and lifeless.  Knowledge cannot be a message.  The wise one will not give you a message,  but will simply awaken you.  </P>
      
      <P>God will not give you a message.  For God to give you a message, God has to be so far away from you.  God is more close to you than your breath.  How can He give you a message?  </P>
      
      <P>The wise neither need a message nor give a message.  The unwise would give a message and want a message -- and would be unable to use the message anyway.  Whoever needs the message will not use it.  And one who can use the message wouldn't need it!  </P>

      <P>The 3 day conference being held at the Ashram during the second week of the summer courses will provide the first truly in-depth look into the direction being taken by the  organization addressing our program for children. Unveiled will be the curricula for the ashram School, set to open its doors in autumn of the year 2000, and we will encourage all conference participants to lend us their vision of an ideal school, a school that will be the exact result of the heart-labors put into it by its supporters. So, we are calling on those parents and educators (and generally those interested in the future of our society) to bring their support and their ideas to this conference which proposes to give children the A.R.T. EXCEL experience all-year long.  Please come and share your vision with us. </P>
      
      <P>This conference, being held the 3rd, 4th, and 5th of July,  is offered at no extra fee, and only to those who are here at the Ashram participating in one of the courses taking place during the second week of courses this summer. This is a perfect adjunct to, but not a replacement for, A.R.T. EXCEL Teacher's Training (being held the first week). We are so fortunate to be in the very eye of this storm of knowledge that is right now already transforming the society in which we live. And how fortunate for our children -- the next generation. </P>
      
      <P>Just to keep people abreast of the registration proceedings at the ashram; for the second week the residence building Bodhisattva has been filled, and the two women's cabins have been filled. So bear in mind that when registering, for a fair amount of people, this will mean that you will be registering for either camping or the condos. Please feel free to contact Sage or Judith at the Ashram for more detailed and up-to-the-minute information.</P>
      <P>**Special Note: Gurudev has requested that a limit on the number of people coming to the ashram be placed. Therefore, all applications will be handled on a first-come first-served basis and must be accompanied with full payment. Again, please recall that phone messages, faxed messages, or emails will not reserve a place on the summer courses, only the full registration process suffices. Please act quickly to reserve your space. </P>
      
      <P>MAHA SEVA: All people who have any time at all to spare or donations to give are requested to contact the Ashram as quickly as possible in response to Guruji's request that the grounds be cleaned and prepared and generally beautified in order to receive various delegates and honored guests to visit during the time of the summer programs.  </P>

      <P>Only a conscious, alert and dynamic person can get bored.  A dull and inert person doesn't get bored.  If you get bored, it indicates you are more alive and human.  It is a sign that you are growing, that you are evolving.</P>

      <P>An animal, for example, keeps doing the same thing. It never gets bored.  Cows, horses, birds do the same things over and over all their lives. </P>
      
      <P>People eat, watch television, change jobs, change partners to escape boredom.  And they get frustrated.  And frustration takes them back to inertia and unconsciousness.</P>
      
      <P>Only in two states the boredom does not occur: in a state of total inertia or in a state of Divine Consciousness.  If you are bored, it indicates you are evolving.  Boredom moves you.</P>
      
      <P>Jim:  Boredom moves you towards the divine. </P>
      
      <P>Guruji:  Yes.  Be proud of your boredom and celebrate!!!!!! </P> 		</font>

      </B>
      <P>Maybe you are bored listening to &quot;the hall was packed&quot; all the time.... Well, in Bogota, Colombia, about 100 people showed up for a morning lecture at the university.  The microphone came at the end and so did most of the people!  About 12 showed up for another university talk, but Guruji was not there.  In contrast, the evening Satsang was so crowded and there was much confusion.  The meditation was reduced to 5 minutes as many had to keep standing.  [McQueen went on strike and refused to write this news flash because it was too factual. (laughter)]</P>
      
      <P>The Dominican Republic's devotion and organizing power pulled Guruji on an 11-hour marathon to reach them.  After his last minute trip to the ocean, Guruji boarded the plane soaking wet.  In Panama the warmth of the Latin-American hearts and songs lit up the Satsangs. In Costa Rica Guruji had a diplomatic reception and a motorcycle escort, and his talk was co-sponsored by  the University of Peace and the National Commission for Human Values. The first Lady, on behalf of the president, received Guruji at the palace and extended her full-hearted support for art of Living activities in Costa Rica. </P>
      
      <P>Guruji was fascinated by the orange fire spewing down the side of the volcano as we drove through the rain forest at midnight. Today the knowledge sheet erupted at the foot of the volcano.</P>

      <P  ALIGN="justify">The role of religion is to make one righteous and loving And 
        politics means caring for people and their welfare. When religion and politics 
        don't coexist then you have corrupt politicians and pseudo-religious leaders. 
      </P>
      </FONT> 
      <p><FONT FACE="Arial">A religious man who is righteous and loving will definitely 
        care for the welfare of the whole population and hence becomes a true politician. 
        And a true politician can only be righteous and loving. He cannot be anything 
        but religious. All the Avatars and prophets have been caring for people and 
        so were in politics. You can find many examples to this effect. </FONT></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">When religions restrict the freedom to worship and restrict 
        modes of worship they become unsuitable for creating a harmonious society. When 
        religion becomes all encompassing and gives full freedom to pray and worship 
        in any manner -- that religion will bring righteousness and peace in people 
        and will be suitable for any society. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">People think politics and religion have to be kept separate 
        because many religions did not give freedom to worship and did not care for 
        all people equally. History has shown that religion has created conflict. But 
        irreligious societies (e.g. communism) have created chaos and corruption. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Today both religion and politics need reform. Religion has 
        to become broader and more spiritual to allow freedom of worship and broader 
        to encompass all the wisdom in the world. And politicians have to become more 
        righteous and spiritual. </font> </p>

      <P>Only one who has renounced can truly love.  To the degree you have renounced, to that degree you have the ability to love. </P>

      <P>Often people think those who renounce cannot love, and those who love cannot renounce.  This is because so-called renunciants do not seem to be in love, and so-called lovers are very possessive and are in need. </P>
      
      <P>True love is non-possessive and brings freedom, and renunciation is nothing but freedom.  Only in freedom can love fully blossom.  When in love you say, &quot;I want nothing, I just want this.&quot;  Renunciation is, &quot; I don't want anything.  I am free.&quot;  In love there is no other need. Renunciation is having no need.  Love and renunciation, although appearing to be opposites, are two sides of the same coin.</P>
      
      <P>McQueen said -- They are the same side of the same coin. (laughter)</P>
      <P>Tara asked -- Does this mean the lover renounces his beloved?</P>
      <P>Guruji responded -- You renounce the attachment, the possessiveness.  Renunciation doesn't diminish love; it enhances it.</P>
      
      <P>Only renunciation can sustain love and joy.  Without renunciation love turns into misery, possessiveness, jealousy and anger. Renunciation brings contentment and contentment sustains love.  Without renunciation one gets discontented, frustrated, sad, fearful, suspicious, analytical.  And the whole soap opera begins.  And this is what we find in society , don't we?</P>
      
      <P>The so-called renunciants have run away from life frustrated and disappointed.  Real renunciation is born out of knowledge and wisdom, knowledge of life in the background of time and space and in the context of this magnanimous universe.</P>

Profound wisdom was flowing along with the debate and laughter of devotees.  Eventually the discussion went haywire.  Belma said, &quot;Guruji, you have the purest intellect. Why do you ask us for our opinion?  Then it only gets all messed up.&quot;  Mikey said, &quot;Those who know will know, and those who don't, won't &quot;  Tommy said, &quot;Those who don't get it are free!&quot; Finally roaring with laughter some devotees renounced the knowledge sheet to go to dinner.</P>
      
      <P>Last night, at an electrifying Satsang full of uncontrollable laughter and dance, Guruji gave paradoxical knowledge that enlightenment is a journey from heart to head  (Of course the talk wasn't taped).</P>
      
      <P>The Clean Gujarat Project has been launched by the devotees from Gujurat.  A Yagna was performed in the Bangalore Ashram to bring peace in Kashmir.  Two of our teachers will be going to Belgrade and Kosovo.</P>

        to be broadcast on national television. Admissions to our schools in India continue

        The time during an eclipse is an auspicious time for doing spiritual practices.

        hatred, jealousy, attraction or entanglements, you have to go to the atom. Going

        not for the suffering of the criminals. It is their karma.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Often people think compassion is an act, 
        an action. Know that compassion is your very nature. Then you will see that 
        karma and compassion are not contradictory but complement each other.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Suppose two people come to a hospital. One

      <p ALIGN="justify"><font face="Arial">Guruji's mother, our beloved AMMA, left her physical body 
        in a peaceful and meditative state at 1p.m. on Nov. 9th, 1999, in Bangalore, 
        just as Guruji set foot in the holy city of Varanasi, precisely as HE had predicted 
        a few days ago. For those present around GURUJI, it was an amazing experience 
        to feel the depth of love and not an iota of grief ! It was a celebration of 
        knowledge, never before experienced! Even as the news came, Guruji kept meeting 
        people and addressed the big Satsang with the same smile as always.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p ALIGN="justify"><font face="Arial">All her life AMMA served with love, humour and dynamism, 
        extending her motherly love to one and all. She had an unparalleled love for 
        GURUJI and shared a unique relationship with HIM - not only as a son but also 
        as a Mentor. Hundreds of people bid a moving farewell to AMMA, singing JAI JAI 
        RADHA RAMAN. AMMA'S mortal ashes were brought to Delhi and GURUJI accompanied 
        them to HARDWAR and immersed them in the Holy Ganges there. A portion of her 
        ashes were also immersed in the river Cauvery, on whose banks AMMA grew up.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="justify"><font face="Arial">On the 9th of Nov., itself, GURUJI was the chief guest at 
        the consecration of the VISHALAKSHI temple at Varanasi, an invitation that had 
        come two months ago. At this very temple, GURUJI'S grandfather had prayed 70 
        years ago and was blessed with AMMA. Creation returned to it's source as GURUJI 
        reinstalled the very same ancient deity from whom AMMA got her name, on the 
        very same day that she left for her Heavenly abode.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="justify"><font face="Arial">The Art of Living family is greatly indebted to AMMA and 
        seek her blessings. The Memorial Service will be on the 21st of November and 
        all Chapters are requested to have Satsangs that day. Through this event the 
        Art of Living has shown to the world that not only Life, but Death also can 
        be a celebration ! </font></p><p align="center"><b><font size="+2"></font></b></p>

        for the first time." This tidal wave continued from the banks of the Ganges 
        at Rishikesh to Varanasi, where more than 4000 swayed in bliss. There is a saying 
        - "Kashi Dhama Marnat Mukti" - dying in Kashi {also known as Varanasi}, you 
        attain salvation.Guruji won over everybody's hearts by commenting that now, 
        even while living in Kashi, people could attain salvation. The Touring Tornado 
        held a hurricane satsang at Delhi and then moved on to Hardwar for the IMMERSION.</font></p>

        among the youth today. Life appears to be so meaningless to these children, 
        who are either too scared of the competitive world or bogged down by heavy stimuli. 
        They need an inspiration.... <br>
        And Spirituality is that inspiration that can keep the spirit up!</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial">Aggression is the antidote to depression. <br>
        Depression sets in if there is a lack of zeal to fight.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"> Depression is lack of energy, and anger and 
        aggression are a bolt of energy. <br>
        When Arjuna was depressed, Krishna inspired him to fight and thus reinstated 
        life back in Arjuna. If you are depressed, don't take Prozac - just fight - 
        for any cause!</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Arial"> If aggression crosses a certain limit it leads 
        you back into depression. That's what happened with King Ashoka, who won the 
        Kalinga war but became depressed. He had to take refuge in Buddha.</font></p>

        to pay homage to the great lady who gave Guruji to this world. Guruji did Aarti 
        to Amma's portrait, singing the same song that Amma used to sing when she did 
        Aarti to Him. Tears flowed from everyone. Guruji shared a few anecdotes about 
        Amma; it is no coincidence that Amma left the body on Yama Dwitiya and the Vaikuntha 
        Samaradhana fell on Vaikuntha Chaturdashi day (the day when Godliness wakes

        of 20,000. The following day saw over 40,000 people spellbound in meditation 
        at the open-air stadium. This was telecast live on local TV. Guruji has devised

      <P>Nature is a mystery. The more you know about nature, the mystery deepens. The more a scientist knows, the more he feels there is much more to know.  Science, though appearing to resolve the mystery in creation, has deepened it. The knowledge of particles, wave functions, black holes, the vacuum state, etc have only deepened the mystery.</P></DIR>

        Every place you are in, has a different impact on the mind. Even in your house, 
        you can see that you feel different in different rooms. A place where there 
        there has been singing, chanting and meditation has a different influence on

        in the Self.</font></p>
      <ol>
        <li><font face="Arial"> <i>Expansion -- Prasarana. </i>Expansion indicates there 
          is already something into which something expands. That which expands cannot 
          be the basis for expansion.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial"><i>Contraction -- Akunchana</i>. Contraction means something 
          shrinks from something else. Self does not withdraw or shrink from anything, 
          so contraction does not exist in the Self.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial"><i>Evolution -- Vriddhi</i>. Evolution is becoming something 
          which it is not already. Self is the same, so it cannot evolve.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial"><i>Decay -- Kshaya</i>. There is no devolution or decay 
          in the Self. It doesn't get old or stale. That's why, when you are close to 
          your Self, you don't feel that you are aging.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial"><i>Beginning -- Anaadi</i>. Self has no beginning. If 
          God has a beginning, then He is no God.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Arial"><i>Lack -- Abhava</i>. Self has no lack. Whatever lacks 
          something is not complete. Self does not lack anything, it is complete. Lack 
          indicates existence of something outside itself. That doesn't exist for the 
          Self. So if you feel you have not grown at all, don't worry, you are close 
          to the Self. (Laughter)</font></li>
      </ol>
      <p><font face="Arial">When your mind is with the Self, then you don't worry about 
        evolution. If you are thinking about evolving, then you are stuck in the mind. 
        And mind is part of the matter, and matter evolves and decays.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">And that is how the experience of contraction and expansion 
        is all play and display of the mind. Mind expands and contracts. When it expands, 
        it comes close to the truth, which has no expansion. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial">Why should you think God is only one? Why can't He also 
        be many? If He has made man in His own image, what image is He? An African, 
        a Mongolian, a Caucasian, a Japanese, a Filipino? Why are there so many types 
        of man, and so many varieties of things?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">There is not just one type of tree, not just one type of 
        snake, cloud, mosquito or vegetable - there is not just one type of anything, 
        so why should God be only one? How could this consciousness that manifested 
        this whole creation and loves variety, be monotonous? God seems to love different 
        varieties. He must be of infinite variety Himself. God can manifest in many 
        names, forms and varieties.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">Some schools of thought may not give God the freedom to 
        appear in His many forms. They want Him in one uniform! </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">You change your appearance to suit the occasion. When such 
        is the case, how could you think there is no variety in the Spirit. The ancient 
        people knew this and that's why they cognized the Divinity as infinite qualities 
        and forms. The Spirit is not dull and boring. The Spirit which is the basis 
        of creation is dynamic and ever changing. God is not only one, but is many!!! 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">When you accept the variety of Divinity you cease to be 
        a fanatic or a fundamentalist.</font></p>

        for fun.<br>

        be solved, then you have accepted it then it is no longer a problem; it is a 
        fact. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial">For example: Suppose you think it is a problem that the

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not lethargic but active <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have strong faith in Divine law </font></p>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>FEEL THE PINCH</B></P>
      
      <FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>A devotee asked Guruji: Please forgive me if I have committed a mistake.</P>

        <P>Sri Sri: Why should you be forgiven? You are asking for forgiveness because you feel a pinch and you want to be free from it, isn't it? Let the pinch be there. The pinch will not let the mistake happen again. Forgiveness removes the pinch and you keep repeating the mistake!</P>
        
        <P>Question: How do you know a mistake is a mistake?</P>
        
        <P>Sri Sri: A mistake is something that gives you a pinch. If it hasn't pinched you, it is not a mistake at all. </P>
        
        <P>It is the pinch that irks the consciousness and that pinch disallows the mistake to be repeated. Be with the pinch and not the guilt. It is a very fine balance.</P>
        
        <P>Question: What is the difference between guilt and pinch?</P>
        
        <P>Sri Sri: Guilt is about a specific action and pinch is about a specific result or happening. You can only feel guilty about what you did and not about what happened. But whatever happened, whether because of you or someone else can cause a pinch in you.</P>
        
        <P>Question: How do we get over the guilt?</P>
        
        <P>Tom Gill: Just blame the boss!!! ( laughter)</P>
        
        <P>Sri Sri: Through wisdom, by knowing the nature of mind, nature of consciousness and from a broader perspective of the phenomenon, you can get over the guilt.</P>
        
        <P>Question: Cant we learn from our mistakes without feeling the pinch?</P>
        
        <P>Sri Sri: Learning is at an intellectual level whereas you feel the pinch at an emotional level. The drive of your emotions is much stronger than your intellect. So a pinch will not let the mistake recur.</P>
        
        <P>Bharat: We feel guilt where we have control, it is at the intellectual level, whereas a pinch is at the emotional level where we do not have control.</P>
        
        <P>Question: So, should we discard the intellect?</P>
        
        <P>Sri Sri: You cannot be driven by your emotions alone. Your intellect acts like a brake for your emotions!</P>
        
        <P>Feel the pinch.  </P>
        <P>The pinch will create an awareness that what happened was beyond your capacity.</P>
        <P>The awareness will bring you to surrender.</P>
        <P>Surrender will free you from guilt.</P>
        <P>So, from pinch to awareness to surrender to freedom are the steps of evolution. </P> 		</font>

      <P>Some are stingy in praising, and some are shy.</P>
      <P>And some others are simply not used to.</P>
      <P>Some praise with motives, and some others just to elevate.</P>
      <P>Others praise themselves in order to hide their low self-esteem.</P>
      <P>The real praise dawns in a blossomed state of consciousness.</P>
      
      <P>The praise that comes out of an elevated state of consciousness is simply its nature and is quite different.  Normally praise comes out of craving and pride. The praise from a heightened consciousness is always out of fulfilment. </P>
      <P>Praising can no doubt elevate the consciousness and bring enthusiasm and energy.  At the same time it can also bring arrogance.  Praising is a skill. </P>
      
      <P>When someone praises you, do you take it without shying away? </P>
      <P>Accepting praise without shyness, is also a skill.</P> 		</font>

      <P>This week we had so much newsthat we are sending just the news flood!</P>
      <B>
      </B><P>It has been an unusually hectic week even by Sri Sri's standards.  Last Friday, Sri Sri addressed three satsangs in a single day, starting with the rural satsang among thousands of poor people of Inchilla, a brief stopover with the enthusiastic devotees of Belgaum, and on to the urban elite of Goa, with the sound of our bhajans reverberating everywhere.</P>
      <P>Ahmedabad was all keyed up as Sri Sri returned after a two-year gap.Teachers from all over Gujarat had been working together to make this the biggest satsang ever.  In the morning, over 25, 000 people did the Sudarshan Kriya conducted &quot;live&quot; by Sri Sri...Intense experiences, strong fragrances, changes in the weather pattern were happening as three eagles circled directly overhead, joined by a flock of other birds Ö a cosmic rhythm was set in motion. Many people shared that their entire life was one side and this event on the other, such was the magnitude of the experience for them.  Kriya was followed by an elaborate lunch for the participants the network of volunteers had organised 60 counters to feed all of them!  </P>
      
      <P>In the evening, the same cricket stadium was transformed, with a huge lotus designed up in the stands for Guruji to sit in, and video screens all over the grounds. It was a sight to see streams of people flooding in, all excited and happy even before the program began, the crowd totalled nearly 200,000!  The traffic diversion for the event was announced by the traffic police well in advance, as THE event took off without any chaos. </P>
      
      <P>Following 27 minutes of total, still meditation, the entire crowd were on their feet, singing and dancing Ö the sub-inspector of police remarked that even though a meagre force of 500 was deployed, they had nothing to do, so blissful and orderly was the crowd. The policemen would hug people, and confessed that only their uniform was preventing them from joining the dance. The high priests of the ancient city of Dwarka (Krishna's capital), came all the way to invite Guruji, and placed a resplendent turban (which was from the temple deity) on His head.</P>
      
      <P>The next day was the foundation-laying ceremony of the Gujarat ashram on the banks of the river Mahi.  After a brief satsang in Vidyanagar, Guruji addressed over 3,000 Art Excel kids Ö it was the best ever question-and-answer session, with witty one-line exchanges between the little ones and the Wise One.</P>
      
      <P>Enthusiastic devotees with a live band awaited Guruji at 4 am in Jamnagar.  Guruji visited the ancient capital of Krishna in Dwarka for a Vishnu Yagna in the ancient Dwarkadheesh Temple. The entire city danced as Guruji was taken in a horse-drawn carriage through the streets of Dwarka's  it was a non-stop celebration.</P>
      
      <P>That evening, we had another Divine Satsang in Jamnagar, before returning to Ahmedabad. The blissful ones are now in Delhi, en route to Rishikesh.</P>
      
      <P>PS: The three-year-old daughter of one of our devotees fell from a three-story building recently.  She told her parents later that &quot;That bearded uncle whose photo we have at home He caught me!&quot; She escaped totally unhurt.  (Caution: Please don't try this at home!!)</P>

      <P>THIS COMES FROM INDIA:</P>
      <P>The Times of India on February 10th came with this article and another about President Clinton's visit to India in March 2000.  In light of the increased awareness of the government of the United States we think that now is the time to awaken all sectors of society to The Art of Living and the projects we are doing around the world, especially our 5H program and our schools in Bangalore, Assam and Bengal.  We would like committees to be formed from Satsang groups to actively participate in contacting their respective Senators and Representatives in each state as soon as possible to convey the vision of the organization and request for full national participation in our service projects in the rural areas of India.  The 5H program involves improvement of the quality of life by addressing Home, Health, Hygiene, Human Values and Harmony in Diversity. For more details about our programs please contact Ajay Tejasvi at ajay_tejasvi@vsnl.com or Dean &amp; Shirley Harmison at Ahimsa108@aol.com.</P></FONT> 		</font>

      <P>A: Form and Formless</P>

      <P>Life is a combination of form and formless.</P>
      <P>Feelings have no form but their expressions have form.</P>
      <P>The Self has no form but its abode has form.</P>
      <P>Similarly, wisdom and grace have no form but are expressed through form.</P>
      <P>Discarding the formless, you become inert, materialistic and paranoid.</P>
      <P>Discarding the form, you become a lost ascetic, a space cadet or an emotional junk!</P>
      
      <P>B: Aggression and Intuition</P>
      
      <P>Aggression and assertiveness overshadow intuition.</P>
      <P>Often, people who are sensitive tend to become aggressive in order to avoid being hurt.</P>
      <P>In this process, they lose sight of the fine intuition.</P>
      <P>Fine intuition needs sensitivity; sensitivity is often painful.</P>
      <P>In order to avoid pain one becomes aggressive and assertive, and in turn loses one's intuitive ability.</P>
      <P>Intuition is close to the truth.</P>
      <P>To be truthful, you don't need to be aggressive and assertive!</P>
      <P>Often, aggression and assertiveness thrive on the idea of truthfulness.</P> 		</font>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>THE GOAL OF ALL ANSWERS</B></P>
      
      <P>Some questions can be answered only in Silence.  Silence is the goal of all answers.  If an answer does not silence the mind it is &quot;no&quot; answer.  </P>

<P>Thoughts are not the goal in themselves. Their goal is Silence.  When you ask the question &quot;Who am I?&quot; you get no answer, there is silence.  That is the real answer.  For your soul is solidified silence.  This solidified silence is wisdom, is knowledge. </P>

<P>The easy way to silence the thoughts is to arouse the feelings.  For through feelings only peace, joy and love dawn.  And they are all your very nature.  </P>

<P>To the question &quot;Who am I?&quot; the only relevant answer is silence.  You need to discard all answers in words, including &quot;I am Nothing&quot; or &quot;I am the Cosmic Self&quot; or &quot;I am the Self&quot; - <I>and just stick to the question &quot;Who am I?&quot;.  </I>All other answers are just thoughts. Thoughts can never be complete.   Only Silence is complete.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">**Quotes**</P>

<P>&quot;You cannot betray somebody, unless you gain trust.  A wicked person first gains trust and then betrays.  Even the deception of a wise man will only do the highest good.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;To be afraid of the wicked, is a sign of bad regime and to be afraid to do bad is a sign of good regime.&quot;</P> 		</font>

      <P>The main impediment of many seekers in the path is that they want to surrender. Don't say that you want to surrender; know that you already are surrendered. </P>

      <P>Wanting to surrender becomes an impediment on the path. This is like a child saying to the mother, " I want to love you." No child ever tells the mother," I</P>
      <P>want to love you", love is evident there.  </P>
      
      <P>Surrender is not an act, it is a state of your being.  Whether you acknowledge it or not, it is there. The wise wake up and see, the unwise take a longer time. </P>
      
      <P>Know that you have no choice, you are in a state of surrender deep within you.</P>

      <P>A four year old child, in an Art Excel meeting, told Sri Sri, " I love you very much." Sri Sri asked, " Why?"  She replied, "Because God has sneaked into your</P>
      <P>heart, and you are in God's heart."</P>
      
      <P>In Satsang, a man asked Sri Sri, " I do not feel the need for a Guru. What is your opinion of people like me?"  Sri Sri replied, with a twinkle in his eye, "Don't take my advice!"  ( LaughterÅ©</P>

      <P>When you're in the grip of feverishness about the result of your actions, what do you do?</P>

      <P>Faith: Have faith and confidence that the result will be much better than you can ever imagine. With faith you can get rid of feverishness of action/achievement.</P>
      <P>Feverishness can also be a hangover from overactivity. Then sleep, listening to flute  music, cold water baths, etc. can help.</P>
      
      <P>Dispassion: Know the whole thing will be over one way or the other, and it doesn't matter. Meditation and breathing can calm you down.  Drop whatever you are doing and do something completely irrelevant, e.g. while decorating your</P>
      <P>house, take a moment off to cut grass, or go shopping!  When you are doing something very important, take a moment off to do something totally irrelevant and insignificant. This enhances your creativity.  Relevant action keeps you bound to the action.  Irrelevant action makes life a game!</P> 		</font>

      <P>1. A desire arises with the memory of a pleasant experience and past impressions.</P>
      <P>2. A desire might arise through listening.</P>
      <P>3. A desire can be triggered through the association of certain people and a place.</P>
      <P>4. Someone else's need or desire may manifest in you as your own desire, e.g. when someone is hungry, you get a desire to feed them or someone wants to talk to you and you get a desire to talk to them.</P>
      <P>5. The destiny or a happening in which you have a part to play may trigger a desire of which you have no idea.  For example,  a gentleman in Quebec, Canada kept making roads and working on a farm for 30 years, not knowing for what -- for it was destined to become our Canadian Ashram.</P> 		</font>

Though the flight was delayed by five hours, thousands waited at the National Opera House, where Guruji was driven straight from the airport.  Even though he had traveled such a long distance, there was not a trace of tiredness as he greeted the cheering crowd.  Guruji tricked the security guards several times and mingled with the crowd.</P>
      
      <P>Meetings and satsangs at Ulaan Bataar were filled with gratitude.  A 10 year old boy who was deaf for several years regained his hearing!

      <P>Buddha said that desire is the cause of all misery.  If your desire does not get fulfilled, it leads to frustration and causes misery.  Even if it does get fulfilled, it leaves you empty.</P>
      <P>  </P>
      <P>Vasishta said that desire is the cause of pleasure.  You get pleasure from an object or a person only when you desire them.  When you do not desire an object, you do not get pleasure from it.  For example, when a person is hot and thirsty, a sip of cold water gives him pleasure; but not if he is not thirsty.   Whatever gives you pleasure binds you and bondage is misery.</P>
      
      <P>Sri Sri says when you desire for truth, all other desires drop off.  You always desire for something that is not there.  But, truth is always there!  Desire for truth removes all other desires and it itself dissolves.  And what remains is bliss. </P> 		</font>

      <P> Education has five aspects</P>

<P>1. Information  -- Often we think information is education, but it is only one aspect of education. </P>

<P>2. Concepts -- Concepts are the basis for all research. You need to conceive in order to create.</P>

<P>3. Attitude -- An integral aspect of education is cultivating the right attitude. Proper attitude at the right time and place determines your actions and behavior. </P>

<P>4. Imagination -- Imagination is essential for creativity, for the arts. But if you get stuck in imagination, you may become psychotic.</P>

<P>5. Freedom -- Freedom is your very nature. Only with freedom, do joy, generosity and other human values blossom. Without freedom, attitudes become stifling, concepts become a burden, information is of no value and imagination becomes stagnant.</P>

      <P>Know that humiliation does not weaken you -- it strengthens you.</P>

      <P>When you have a sense of belongingness, you don't feel humiliated.  The more egotistic you are, the more humiliation you feel.  When you are childlike and have a greater sense of kinship then you don't feel humiliated.</P>
      
      <P>When you are committed to truth and not to your ego then you also don't feel humiliated. </P>
      
      <P>If you are afraid of humiliation, you can neither make progress in your material life nor in your spiritual life.  When you stand above humiliation, you get closer to the Self - to God. When you are steeped in love, with the Existence, with the Divine, nothing whatsoever can humiliate you.</P>
      
      <P>So, the way out of humiliation is:</P>
      <P>Get humiliated!</P>
      <P>Be childlike</P>
      <P>Be crazy</P>
      <P>Get steeped in love with the Divine</P>

      <P>Virtues cannot be cultivated. You have to assume that they are there.</P>

      <P>In the Gita, Krishna said to Arjuna, "Grieve not Arjuna, you are born with virtues."</P>
      
      <P>The seeker should remember that he is born with virtues; otherwise he could not have been a seeker. </P>
      
      <P>If you think you do not have virtues and then try to cultivate them, you will fail.</P>
      
      <P>You often compare yourself with others on the basis of virtues. Do not compare yourself with them. Simply recognize all the virtues you appreciate in others, and realize that they are already present in you in seed form. You only have to nurture them.</P>
      
      <P>When you think you do not have a virtue, then you come from a space of lack or deficiency. </P>
      
      <P>Caroline: Aho! That is why we don't need positive affirmations!</P>
      
      <P>Alice: Affirmations really don't work anyway.</P>
      
      <P>Sri Sri: Affirmations do not work because you think you do not have those virtues, and with affirmation you try to have them.</P>
      
      <P>And so Caroline affirms: You are the home of all virtues. (laughter)</P> 		</font>

      <P>Action is out of conscious decision. Reaction is out of impulsiveness.</P>

      <P>Impulsiveness creates a chain of Karma.</P>
      
      <P>Reaction, as well as non-action, both create karma, but a conscious action transcends karma. Conscious action does not create new karma whereas</P>
      <P>non-action can create karma.</P>
      
      <P>For example, a soldier shooting in war does not create a karma; a policeman using tear gas does not create a Karma, and if you are a doctor and you do not give medicine to a patient in need, you are incurring a karma.</P>
      
      <P>Through knowledge and devotion, transcend all karmas and be free!</P>

      <P>If you are in love, you feel weak because love makes you weak. Yet there is no power stronger than love. Love is strength.

      <P>Fights can only happen among equals. When you fight with someone, you make them equal. But in reality there is no one at par with you. When you keep people either above or below you, then there is no fight. </P>

      <P>When they are above you, you respect them. </P>
      
      <P>When they are below you, you love them and you feel compassionate.</P>
      
      <P>Either submission or compassion can take you out of a fight in no time. This is one way to look at it when you are tired of fighting. When you are well rested, just fight and have fun. </P>
      
      <P>The same is true of the mind. As long as the mind thinks it is equal to the senses, there is conflict. When it realizes that it is bigger than the senses, there is no conflict. And when the mind is smaller than the senses, like in animals, there is no conflict. When the mind is caught up in the senses, there is constant conflict. When it transcends the senses, it comes back to its true nature, which is innocence - in no sense. </P>

      <P>Do not tell a person a mistake he knows. What's the use of pointing out a mistake that he knows he has committed? By doing this, you will only make them feel more guilty, defensive or resentful and this will only create more distance.</P>

      <P>When you are on a spiritual path, you are not thankful or obliged to anybody. In the Gita, Krishna says, "He is dear to Me who neither goes on thanking people nor hates anyone (Na abhinandati na dveshthi)." </P>

      <P>Thanking and feeling obliged indicates that you believe in some one else's existence rather than in the Divine who is ruling everything. When you feel obliged, then you are not honoring the principles of karma or the divine plan.</P>
      
      <P>Appreciate people for what they are, do not thank them for what they do. Otherwise your thankfulness is centered around ego. You are grateful, but not for an act. You are grateful for what is. As every individual is nothing but a puppet of the ONE, thanking and being obliged is simply an exhibition of ignorance.  Everything is ruled, controlled and managed by one Divinity, that consciousness has to shine forth in every act of yours; you do not have to make a mood of it.  </P>
      
      <P>Q: Guruji, we are so grateful to you, what should we do?</P>

      <P>It is okay for you to show your upset mood or tendency once in a while, but doing it over and over again is taxing for you and people you love. </P>
      
      <P>If you feel down, appease and please yourself. Your need to be appeased by someone else is the sign of grossness. This is the root of ignorance. If you want attention, all you get is tension. </P>
      
      <P>Become one whose enthusiasm never dies, come what may.</P>
      
      <P>It is not possible to attain Divine Love with a complaining face. The complaining face is a sign of an unaware mind. If you want to complain, complain to God or your Guru because both have their ears covered. (Laughter)</P> 		</font>

      <P>NEWS FLASH </B>From a village near Alwar in Rajasthan, a nine year old girl, Uma, who was dumb from birth started speaking after her ART Excel Course. The same was reported of a twelve year old boy from Vallabh Vidyanagar in Gujarat.</P>
      
      <P>Talakatora Stadium in Delhi was aptly decorated for a grand Satsang. Thousands who could not enter the stadium could still fully participate thanks to the big screens provided by the organizers. Guruji went to Rishikesh to inspire and to get inspired by the 108 youth leaders who were going to take up the 5H Program.</P>

      <P>When a river meets the ocean, the river no longer remains a river. It becomes the ocean. A drop of the ocean is part of the ocean. In the same way, the moment a devotee meets (surrenders to) the Divine, the devotee becomes GOD. When the river meets the ocean, it recognizes that it is the ocean from the beginning to the end. Similarly, the individual "IÅ® IÅ®" dissolves in ONE Divinity.</P>

<P>Question: What about backwaters?</P>

<P>Sri Sri: Sometimes the ocean goes into the river to greet it. Sometimes it seems that the ocean is pushing back the river. Similarly, the Divine puts many questions and doubts in the mind or gives an amazing experience to bring one back home.</P>

      <P>In a state of ignorance, imperfection is natural and perfection is an effort. </P>
      <P>In a state of wisdom or enlightenment, imperfection is an effort; perfection is a compulsion and is unavoidable! </P>
      <P>Perfection is taking total responsibility, and total responsibility means knowing that you are the only responsible person in the whole world. When you think that others are responsible, then your degree of responsibility diminishes. </P>
      <P>When you are in total Vairagya (dispassion), you can take care of even trivial and insignificant things with such perfection. For example, during the Pooja every morning, Guruji decorates the Pooja table with flowers with such great care, choosing different color combinations and patterns everyday; fully knowing that the decoration is not going to last even 10 minutes. After the Pooja He himself would remove the garlands from the Pooja table or shower people with the flowers on it. Yet even while He is in a deep state of Samadhi, He would effortlessly and lovingly decorate the Pooja table everyday. It is obvious that it does not matter how the flowers are kept, but still attention to even such a trivial thing with such keenness of awareness can only come through utter dispassion. </P>
      <P>Perfection is the very nature of the Enlightened one.</P> 		</font>

      </B><P>Deepawali happens.</P>
      <P>Today is Deepawali, the festival of lights. There are many stories associated with this day.</P>
      <P>It was this day that the demon Narakasaura was killed. King Narakasura (Naraka means hell) had been granted a boon that he could be destroyed only by a woman. Lord KrishnaÒ³ wife Satyabhama was the one to destroy him.</P>
      
      <P>Why only Satyabhama could kill Naraka? Satya means truth and bhama means the beloved. Untruth or lack of love cannot conquer hell.&nbsp; It cannot be removed by aggression. Hell can only be erased by love and surrender. Non-aggression, love and surrender are the inherent qualities of a woman. Hence only Satyabhama, the true beloved could remove hell and bring the light back. And NarakasuraÒ³ last wish was that every house should celebrate his exit with lights to mark the end of darkness. This is Deepawali.</P>
      
      <P>Also it was today that Lord Rama returned to Ayodhya, his Kingdom, after his victory over Ravana, the demon king. Ayodhya means that which cannot be destroyed, i.e. life. Ram means the Atma (the Self). When Self rules in life, then knowledge lights up. There is life everywhere. But when the spirit is awakened in life, deepawali happens.</P> 		</font>

      <P>Both are on a journey.&nbsp; Whereas a tourist is satisfying the senses, a pilgrim is in the quest of the truth. A tourist gets tired and tanned, while a pilgrim sparkles with spirit. Every move a pilgrim makes is with sacredness and gratitude, while a tourist is often preoccupied and unaware. </P>
      
      <P>A tourist compares with other experiences and places and hence is not in the present moment. But a pilgrim has a sense of sacredness, so he tends to be in the present moment. </P>
      
      <P>Most people in life are just tourists without even being aware of it. Only a few make their life a pilgrimage. Tourists come, look around, take pictures in their mind, only to come back again.  Pilgrims are at home everywhere and are hollow and empty.&nbsp; </P>

      <P>When you are neither clear nor confused, only then can you be a perfect instrument of the Divine! How would an instrument know what is going to be, and when? How can an instrument be confused, and how can an instrument be clear!</P>

<P>This state is called Nimit - just being an instrument of the Divine. Being very clear means not opening to new possibilities and can lead to limitations. Unlimited possibilities are open to one who is not clear and not confused.</P>

<P>Your mind swings from clarity to confusion and confusion to clarity but the state in which there is no doership nor inertia is the most creative and progressive state.</P>

<P>Sharmila: Will this not lead to lethargy?</P>

<P>Sri Sri: No. A sharp instrument does its job perfectly, effortlessly.</P>

<P>Sharmila: What about focus?</P>

<P>Sri Sri: Focus is natural to a dynamic consciousness.</P>

<P>Confusion arises when new information flows in and clarity is lost. Then confusion again seeks clarity. Clarity constricts the possibility of new information. A confused consciousness seeks clarity and every confusion is breaking away from clarity.</P>

<P>If there is only confusion, there is frustration. If there is only clarity, there is rigidity.</P>

<P>After giving contradictory knowledge, Krishna tells Arjuna, "Just be Nimit!" And to be an instrument, the prerequisite is to be madly in love! That's why in love there is neither confusion nor clarity; or there is both - confusion and clarity!</P>

<P>Nazreen: Is truth more important than love?</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>SACREDNESS AND YOU</B></P>
      
      <P>Throughout the ages, in all cultures, place, time, persons and symbols were all considered sacred. Whenever you consider a symbol, place, time, person or act sacred, your attention is undivided and whole. When things are ordinary and same, you tend to slip into unawareness and inertia. The moment you consider something sacred, your inertia disappears and you become more alive. There is nothing as fulfilling as a sacred act. You put your heart and soul in a sacred act. When every action of yours becomes sacred, you have become one with the Divine. Then every minute of your life is sacred, every place you go to becomes sacred, every person you meet is only your reflection, and every act of yours is sacred.</P>

      <P>Question: Why does an act when performed repeatedly lose it sacredness? </P>
      </FONT><FONT SIZE=3>
      </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>Sri Sri: This happens when your memory overpowers your consciousness and you lose your sensitivity. For example, people living in Benares do not feel that it is a sacred place. That sensitivity is just not there.</P>
      
      <P>Question: How can we preserve that feeling of sacredness in our acts?</P>
      
      <P>Sri Sri: Through living in the present moment and through Sadhana. Your Sadhana will not allow your memory to overpower consciousness. Repetition is not a hindrance then.</P>
      
      <P>The Native American Indians and the tribals consider the earth, sun, moon and all the directions as sacred. In the ancient tradition, the Rishis considered all the rivers, mountains and even animals, trees and herbs as sacred. What to say of people? They are definitely sacred!</P>
      
      <P>In different parts of the world, certain symbols, certain places and different times of the year are considered sacred. Various cultures honor certain people and consider them as sacred. For example, Christians consider the Cross, Jerusalem, Christmas and the Pope as sacred. For Muslims, the Crescent Moon, Mecca and the month of Ramadan are sacred. The Hindus consider the river Ganges, the Himalayas and the Swamis as sacred.</P>
      
      <P>It is good to begin feeling that some symbols, places, time and people are sacred so that you can be awake and alive. But eventually you need to transcend and feel that the entire creation and your whole life is sacred. For the man of God, the whole world, with all its symbols, places and people are sacred at all times.</P>
      
      <P>BE A MAN OF GOD!</FONT><FONT SIZE=3> </P>

      <P>You are made up of love.&nbsp; If you say, "I am not God," you are denying that God is love. If you are love and you say, "I am not God," you are saying God is not love, and that is blasphemy. </P>
      
      <P>"I am" is your consciousness. If you say, "I am not God," you deny that God is aware, alert and awake.&nbsp; You exist. When you say, "I am not God," you deny God of a portion of existence, and that is blasphemy.&nbsp; Also, you are denying the scriptures that say, "God made man in His own image."  If you say, "I am not God," you are denying God. </P>
      
      <P>Question:&nbsp; If God is omnipresent, why is there hatred and suffering in this world?</P>
      
      <P>Sri Sri:&nbsp; Just as in a movie, it doesn't matter whether it is a tragedy or a comedy, or one with a happy ending; in the Absolute there are no opposites. All the opposites are part of&nbsp;relative existence. </P>
      
      <P>Relative existence&nbsp;is not the complete picture. Good and bad, right and wrong, everything is relative. For example, milk is good, but too much milk can kill you. A drop of poison can save a life (most medicines have "POISON" written on them). These are neither absolutely good nor bad; they are just there.</P>
      
      <P>Truth transcends duality, and God is the absolute and only truth. In a movie, when light passes through the film, it doesn't matter to the light what the film is. Tragedy or comedy, hero or villain, the light is always there.</P>
      
      <P>In the same way, no matter what is happening in your mind, YOU ARE GOD!  </P>

      <FONT FACE="Arial"><P>It is difficult to see God as formless and it is difficult to see God as form. The formless is so abstract and God in a form appears to be too limited. So some people prefer to be atheists.  </P>

        <P>Atheism is not a reality, it is just a matter of convenience. When you have a spirit of enquiry, or in search of truth, atheism falls apart. With a spirit of enquiry, you cannot deny something which you have not disproved. An atheist denies God without first disproving it. In order to disprove God, you must have enormous knowledge. And when you have enormous knowledge, you cannot disprove it! (laughter!)For one to say that something does not exist, one should know about the whole universe. So you can never be one hundred percent atheist. An atheist is only a believer who is sleeping!</P>
        
        <P>For a person to say, "I don't believe in anything", means he must believe in himself - so he believes in himself about whom he does not even know!</P>
        
        <P>An atheist can never be sincere because sincerity needs depth - and an atheist refuses to go to his depth. Because the deeper he goes, he finds a void, a field of all possibilities - he has to accept that there are many secrets he does not know. He would then need to acknowledge his ignorance, which he refuses to do, because the moment he is sincere, he seriously starts doubting his atheism. A doubt-free atheist is next to impossible! So you can never be a sincere and doubt-free atheist. </P>
        
        <P>When the atheist realizes his ignorance, what does he do? Where does he go? Does he go to a Guru? What does a Guru do to him? (Wait for next week's knowledge!)</P> 		</font>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>ATHEISM</B></P>
      
      <P>Atheism is when one does not believe either in values or in the abstract. When an atheist comes to the Guru, what happens? You start experiencing your own form and discover that you are indeed formless, hollow and empty. And this abstract non-form in you becomes more and more concrete!!!</P>

      <P>The guru makes the abstract more real and what you thought as solid appears to be more unreal. Sensitivity and subtlety dawns. Perception of love, not as an emotion, but as the substratum of existence becomes evident. The formless spirit shines through every form in creation and mystery of life deepens, shattering the atheism. Then the journey begins and it has four stages.</P>
      
      <P>The first stage is Saarupya (to see the formless in the form) Ö Seeing God in all the forms. Often, one feels more comfortable to see God as formless rather than with a form, because with a form, one feels a distance, a duality, a fear of rejection and other limitations. In life all of our interactions are with the form, other than in deep sleep and in Samadhi. And, if you do not see God in the form, then the waking part of life remains devoid of the Divine. All those who accept God to be formless use symbols, and perhaps love the symbols more than God himself! If God comes and tells a Christian to leave the cross or a Muslim to drop the crescent, perhaps he may not do it! To begin with loving the formless is possible only through forms.</P>
      
      <P>The second stage is Saamipya (closeness) Ö feeling absolutely close to the form you have chosen and reaching out to the formless. This leads to a sense of intimacy with the whole creation. In this stage, one overcomes the fear of rejection and other fears. But this is time and space bound.</P>
      
      <P>The third stage is Saanidhya - feeling the presence of the Divine by which you transcend the limitations of time and space.</P>
      
      <P>Then the final stage Ö Saayujya Ö is when you are firmly entrenched with the Divine. It is then you realize you are one with the Divine. There is a total merging with the Beloved and all duality disappears.</P>
      
      <P>THIS IS THAT AND THAT IS THIS.</P>
      
      <P>Vinod Mathur: Does a believer also go through these four stages?</P>
      
      <P>Sri Sri: Certainly, whether an atheist or believer, he goes through the four stages.</P>

      <P>Often, in establishing your righteousness, you are insensitive to othersÔ feelings. When someone is hurt, arguing with them and establishing your righteousness will be in vain. By saying a simple &quot;Sorry&quot;, you can uplift the other and take away the bitterness. In many situations saying &quot;Sorry&quot; is better than establishing your righteousness. It can avert much unpleasantness. </P>

      <P>This one word of five letters, when said sincerely can remove anger, guilt, hatred and distance.</P>
      
      <P>Many people feel pride in hearing &quot;Sorry&quot; from others. This boosts their ego. But when you say &quot;Sorry&quot; to a wise man, it evokes compassion at your ignorance. However, when you say &quot;Sorry&quot; to your Guru, He will get angry and say, &quot;Go! Listen to Ashtavakra!&quot; (Laughter) For your saying &quot;Sorry&quot; indicates doership. You feel that YOU have MADE a mistake.</P>
      
      <P>A mistake is part of an unconscious mind. An unconscious mind cannot do right. A conscious mind can do no wrong. The mind which makes the mistake and the mind which realizes the mistake - saying &quot;Sorry&quot; - are entirely different, arenÒ´ they? The mind which says &quot;Sorry&quot; cannot be an unconscious mind. Therefore, saying &quot;Sorry&quot; sincerely is a BIG MISTAKE!!!</P>
      
      <P>Did you get it or are you confused? If you didn't get it, don't feel sorry orÅ¹ou can feel sorry!! (Laughter)</P>

      <P>The City Council in Alpharetta, Georgia, USA, planned to remove several 150-year old oak trees as part of a street-widening project.

A devotee put Guruji's picture on each tree and phoned the city officials to tell them the trees were protected by a saint. Word spread through the town and 300 protestors, along with full media coverage, showed up at the City Council. Plans were abandoned, and the trees are happily standing.</P></FONT>

      <P>So many people are stuck with what is "important". Why do you always have to do only that which is important? Most people are caught up thinking about what is important.</P>

      <P>For something to be important, there need to be many things that are unimportant. So you cannot eliminate unimportant things. It is important to have unimportant things to make something else important. (Laughter.) Things are either themselves important or they make other things important. So that means everything is important, and. everything is unimportant.</P>
      
      <P>When you realize this fact you become choiceless.</P>
      
      <P>When you say something is important you are limiting your vastness.</P>
      
      <P>A journalist asked me, "Why is it important to breathe?" "Why is it important to be happy?" "Why is it important to have peace?" These questions are not relevant at all. Why should you always look for what is important? Something that is unimportant can contribute to something that is important. And what is important and unimportant changes with time and space. Food is important when you are hungry and unimportant when you are full. </P>
      
      <P>When something is inevitable you don't categorize it as important or unimportant. It is beyond choice.</P>
      
      <P>"Everything is important" is karma yoga. "Nothing is important" is deep meditation.</P> 		</font>

      <P>A Montreal devotee who is a cab driver by profession picked up a passenger one night who appeared overcome by drugs and alcohol. The passenger demanded to be taken to his destination for half-fare, and when the driver protested he pulled a gun. At first the driver was afraid, but when he looked at the photo of Gurudev on the dashboard he felt completely protected. During the drive, the passenger put the gun away. Eventually he asked&nbsp; who was the person in the photo. When they reached the destination, the passenger bowed to the picture and paid the driver the full fare along with a handsome tip.</P>

      <P>The City Council in Alpharetta, Georgia, USA, planned to remove several 150-year old oak trees as part of a street-widening project. The engineering firm, cable company, and phone company made their studies and gave approval. Local people who wanted to save the trees were told, "There's no hope; it's finished."  A devotee  -- Juanita Rocca -- put Guruji's picture on each tree and phoned the city officials to tell them the trees were protected by a saint. Word spread through the town and 300 protestors, along with full media coverage, showed up at the City Council. Plans were abandoned, and the trees are happily standing.</P>

      <P>For a flame to go up, you need space above. In the same way, for a man to rise up in his life, he needs an ideal, he needs something to adore and worship. Worship is the culmination of love and appreciation. Worship prevents love from turning into hatred or jealousy, and appreciation into low self-esteem. In life, if you do not adore or appreciate anything, you will be filled with negativity. And a person who has nothing to worship or adore is sure to fall into depression. </P>

      <P>Lack of adoration has led to many emotional, psychological and social problems in the society. If you have nothing to hold up high in life, selfishness, arrogance and violence are sure to follow. Adoring and honoring each other in society eliminates stress and fosters compassion and love.</P>
      
      <P>In the previous century, it was thought that worshipping was an uncivilized and unintelligent thing to do. Worship was thought to rise from a slavish mentality. In fact it is just the contrary. Worship can only happen through gratefulness and not through slavish mentality.</P>
      
      <P>In worship, a sense of belongingness, love, honor and respect all come together. Without a sense of belongingness, worship or idealism can bring low self-esteem. The ancient people knew this so they insisted that people should feel part of what they worship. They encouraged people to worship the sun, moon, mountains, rivers, plants, animals and people.</P>
      
      
      <P>WORSHIP IN A TRUE SENSE IS A SIGN OF MATURITY AND NOT WEAKNESS.</P>
      
      <P>Question: You said worship is the culmination of love. Does worship also have a culmination?</P>
      
      <P>Answer: Culmination of worship is Self knowledge, Samadhi.</P> 		</font>

This is why the enlightened age is also called the Aquarian age. Kumbha denotes a pot, which is symbolic of fullness and perfection.</P>

        <P>NEWS FLASH </B>Guruji was in Prayag for the Kumbha Mela. There were many very touching incidents that happened which show the depth of the devotion of the people who had gathered there. Here are two of them. </P>
        
        <P>One morning, Guruji noticed an 80-year-old woman who had been separated from her folks. She looked tired and hungry. Guruji sent someone to give her some money, which she refused to accept saying that she had come here to give, not to take! Guruji Himself had to go to her and tell her that the money was prasad, which she then took from Him. </P>
        
        <P>It was very cold there every night, the temperature dropping to 2 or 3 deg Celsius, and a lot of people had no accommodation whatsoever and would just sleep in the sand on the banks of the rivers, most of them not even having a shawl to cover themselves with. Guruji along with some yuvacharyas and other devotees would go and distribute a lot of blankets every night to these people. Thousands of blankets were distributed every night One night, they came across a teenager who was shivering with cold and gave him some blankets to cover himself with, which he refused to take saying, that he could bear this cold, and that there were so many others who would need them much more than him. </P>
        
        <P>Guruji later told everyone to note the devotion and the total surrender of these people who even in such desperate circumstances had such absolute faith in the Divine and knew that He would provide for them.</P>
        
        <P>Our Ashram was bustling with activity all day long and attracted many people; food was being served continuously, throughout the day. The community of saints there was overjoyed to meet with Guruji and lauded the work of Art of Living. </P>
        
        <P>Back in Delhi Guruji had very fruitful meetings with various leaders including the leader of Jamma Masjid.</P>

<P>The main disadvantages of being friendly are:</P>
<P>1. You come under obligation</P>
<P>2. You lose your freedom</P>
<P>3.&nbsp;You can't have a free and fair perception. Your thoughts and actions may not be impartial</P>
<P>4.&nbsp;Your focus, commitment, creativity and above all your time&nbsp;will be wasted</P>
<P>5&nbsp; You will pick up bad habits and negative moods easily</P>

<P>It takes a lot of wisdom to be free from the burden of obligation and not be influenced by your friends' opinions and feelings.</P>

<P>In many occasions, it is better to be unfriendly than be friendly. Being unfriendly does not mean being aggressive and inimical. The best secretaries,&nbsp;personal&nbsp;assistants, security personnel, and judges have to be unfriendly.</P>

<P>Those who are aloof and indifferent get centered more quickly than those who are too friendly. A certain degree of aloofness in every relationship will strengthen your personality and connect you to your source.</P>

<P>Vinod Sethi: It's very easy to be very aloof or very friendly. But to be friendly and aloof is a Sadhana.</P>

Your true security is in the Self<B> </B>not in bricks and mortar. Perhaps this is what Nature wants to convey to you.

    <P>Fear moves you from dullness to alertness.</P>
    
    <P>Total lack of fear may lead to destructive tendencies - a distorted ego knows no fear. Neither does the expanded consciousness! Whereas the ego dismisses the fear and moves in a disruptive manner, the wise one acknowledges the fear and takes refuge in the Divine.</P>
    
    <P>When you are in love, when you are surrendered, there is no fear. Ego, too, knows no fear. But there is a difference, like that of heaven and earth, between these two types of fearless states.</P>
    
    <P>Fear makes you righteous; fear brings you close to surrender; fear keeps you on the path; keeps you from being destructive. Peace and law are maintained on the planet because of fear.</P>
    
    <P>A new-born child knows no fear - it totally relies on its mother. Whether a child, a kitten or a bird, when they start becoming independent they experience fear which makes them go running back to their mothers.&nbsp; This is inbuilt by nature to sustain life.</P>
    
    <P>So, the purpose of fear is to bring you back to the source!!</P> 		</font>

    <P>NEWS FLASH</B> Guruj's entire journey from Bombay to Surat was punctuated by Darshan. Enthusiastic devotees, in hundreds, thronged every station. 40,000 attended the live Kriya in Surat setting off a wave of energy, culminating in a high-vol satsang of over 300,000 people.</P>
    
    <P>On to Ahmedabad, where Guruji's meeting with the Chief Minister and bureaucrats proved extremely useful. Guruji suggested drastic changes in the lay-out plan of the 900 quake-hit villages which are to be rebuilt. His ideas were greatly appreciated and immediately incorporated.</P>
    
    <P>Guruji wondered whether He was awakening people or not, but devotees who showed up all night at different stations between Ahmedabad and Udaipur, armed with musical bands, definitely kept waking everyone up with their fervor!</P>
    
    <P>Guruji's first ever visit to the City of Jheels (lakes), Udaipur, saw a grand satsang. He also met with NGO's and gave a highly illuminating talk on Integrated Social Development. Gliding softly over the moon-lit waters in a boat to the glittering Jagmandir, He was given a royal reception and the satsang happened in regal splendour!</P>
    
    <P>&quot;When the Divine dwells in your heart, the whole world appears to you as a temple¦quot;</P>
    
    <P>Guruji's entourage decided that it was high time He stopped traveling by train. On the last leg of this wonderfully eventful trip from Udaipur to Delhi, there was a brief stop-over for 20 minutes at Jaipur where a welcome stage and over a thousand devotees compelled Guruji to deplane and give Darshan right there, even at the airport, where Satsang happened spontaneously!!!</P>

      <P>Ego is an impediment for a leader, wise man, merchant or a servant, but it is a necessity for a warrior, a competitor.</P>
      <P>A warrior is one who takes on challenges and commitment and stands by it. </P>
      <P>Ego makes one sacrifice oneself for a cause. Ego gives strength and courage, brings valour to meet the challenges with endurance and perseverance. A strong ego will counteract depression. Often ego is thought to be selfish but it is the greatest motivating factor for creativity and generosity.</P>
      <P>Ego propels one to venture into the unknown.</P>
      <P>There are 3 types of ego - Sattvic, Rajasic and Tamasic.</P>
      
      <UL>
      <LI>Tamasic ego is barbaric and blind, and has self-destructive tendencies. </LI>
      <LI>Rajasic ego is self-centered and causes misery to oneself and others. </LI>
      <LI>Sattvic ego is creative and has protective tendencies. </LI></UL>
      
      <P>If you cannot surrender, at least have a Sattvic ego, as a Sattivic ego is always ready to sacrifice.</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>THE PARADOX OF SACRIFICE</B></P>
      
      <P>All the scriptures of the world glorify sacrifice. What is sacrifice?</P>

<P>It is giving up something that you value. You can only sacrifice that which you would like to keep for yourself; in other words, that which gives you pleasure and joy. You cannot sacrifice something that you dislike or disown. Sacrifice is always related to a higher cause for a greater good. At the same time, when your love for the greater good is so strong, nothing else assumes any value. Sacrifice here becomes irrelevant, because love alone is your strongest driving force. So when there is so much love there cannot be sacrifice. At the same time when there is no love, there is no sacrifice.</P>

<P>For example, if a mother has made plans to see a movie and she realizes that her child is sick, she does not say that she has sacrificed the movie to nurse her child, because she simply did not want to go. Nothing else seems to charm the mother besides being with her child.</P>

<P>You do not sacrifice something for someone you are in love with. Sacrifice indicates that your pleasure has more value than the cause for which you are sacrificing. When the love is lukewarm, then sacrifice assumes meaning. Yet sacrifice purifies the human mind and reins in selfish tendencies. It can also bring pride, arrogance, self-pity and sometimes even depression. </P>

<P>You can sacrifice only that which you value. For a wise man nothing is more valuable than truth, values and the Divine, and he will never sacrifice those. God is the greatest, and if he values the greatest then how can he sacrifice God? This is the paradox of sacrifice.</P> 		</font>

      <FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Divinity is unmanifest, but man has an innate desire to perceive the divine in the manifest creation around him. He creates idols, breathes faith into it and requests divinity to be present in that idol for a while, so that he can worship, express his love and play with it. At the end of his worship he requests divinity to go back into his heart from where divinity manifested. This is in all puja practices. </P>

        <P>They are not actually worshipping the idols but worshipping the unmanifest divinity which has all the divine qualities. So, the idol worshippers of the East are not the same as the ones in the Middle East as described in the Bible, because they are not just worshipping different gods and different idols, they are worshipping the ONE divinity in many different forms. </P>
        
        <P>Paganism, Satan and animal worship, without the knowledge of the one divinity is very different from seeing the divine in every form of the manifest universe. In the eastern tradition, gods and goddesses are part of the one divinity like the different colors of white sunlight, whereas in the Greek tradition, gods and goddesses are in themselves different entities. </P>
        
        <P>Worshipping Satan and different entities is totally different from worshipping divinity in its various forms. Every form belongs to the divine. When you adore the form, you are adoring the divine behind the form. </P>
        
        <P>With this knowledge, the very act of worship, which is more an inner phenomenon, assumes a more colorful and vibrant expression, indicating that both the form and the formless are all divine. </P> 		</font>

        <P>5H WALK REPORT: </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>25,000 people in 30 cities on 5 continents participated in the first Walk for 5H on Sunday, March 11, 2001, which evolved into the 5H Walk for Gujarat after the recent earthquake in India.</P>
        
        <P>The initial seed was planted by Bawa as he toured the US teaching DSN courses last fall, where course participants took responsibility for organizing a 5H walk in their local area as a follow-up seva project.  One thing led to another, and soon, cities all around the world had signed up to participate in this unique global 5H event, where all the participating cities walked to raise awareness and funds for 5H projects already taking place in the earthquake-affected areas of Gujarat.</P>
        
        <P>Walk coordinators quickly realized that organizing a walk was no small feat - it required a committed team of volunteers to carefully plan and execute the many details involved.  Some had to overcome many obstacles in pulling a team together.  But after the event everyone had experienced such overwhelming personal growth.  Amit from Boston said, "I had always thought that a lot of my buttons were dead.  I worked through the last one month with so many of my buttons getting pushed, with tons and tons of grumbling and complaining. Even with so much awareness I could not change the state of my mind.  But just as the walk ended on Sunday, something flipped and I felt centered again. This was sooo amazing!&quot;</P>
        
        <P>The overwhelming grace of the Guru was the invisible hand that guided all those involved. Madhu from Washington DC said, "Just 3 days before the event we had no media coming but we decided to call the major press and news channels anyway.  Early on Sunday morning, NBC, CBS and FOX were all eagerly awaiting to televise the event even before the volunteers had turned up, and The Washington Post (the major local newspaper) came to cover the event.  I just can't understand how this happened - this is simply unheard of!"  Senator Hillary Clinton also sent a personal letter strongly supporting the walk.  She said, "I am grateful for your dedication to this important cause.  It is my hope that your efforts will inspire others to take part in actions large and small, public and private, to uplift individuals, families, communities and nations throughout our global society."</P>
        
        <P>The skillful combination of buzzing daily satsangs balanced with die-hard seva warriors scouring the streets late into the night ensured that everyone in Dallas knew about 5H and the walk.  "20,000 people know about the walk here.  There is not one street corner we've left unturned.  The energy here is unbelievable," said James Paul.</P>
        
        <P>The walk was a perfect symbol of harmony in diversity, pulling together diverse groups of people from several communities.  Jeffrey from Jakarta said, "300 Jakarta citizens, some coming by chartered buses as far as 1.5 hours away, came to walk for 5H.  Participants came from diverse nationalities and religious beliefs.  A catholic organization, St. Karnaius, even provided an ambulance to cover the walk."</P>
        
        <P>The Maha 5H walk took place in Mumbai.  Here the walk started from 5 different points of a circle, each group converging at the center of the circle, the landmark Shivaji Park.  The first group to arrive at the park was met within minutes by all the other groups who also converged at the park like clockwork.  The post-event celebrations started with a street play symbolizing the 5H's and culminated into a rocking satsang of 5,000.  Dinesh noted, "There was definitely a Harmony in Diversity.  Not only Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, the Maharashtrians, the Gujaratis and the South Indians but also the young and the old, the rich and the poor walked shoulder to shoulder and sang heart to heart."</P>
        
        <P>And finally, once it was all over, Ashish from Dallas exclaimed, "Hey guys, it's not over!  This was just the first step."</P></FONT>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>STRENGTH AND SUBORDINATION</B></P>
      
      <P>Many people do not want to work under someone else, be it in their profession, in any company or even voluntary service. The general notion is that when you work under someone, you lose your freedom, you have to be answerable.</P>

      <P>So, many people opt for business, wanting to be their own boss. But, in business, you are accountable to so many people. If you cannot be accountable to even one person, how can you be accountable to many? This is the paradox. In fact, being in business binds you more than the boss!</P>
      
      <P>Refusing to work under someone is a sign of weakness, not strength. A strong person would not feel uncomfortable working under anyone, because he knows his strength. It is the weak and poor in spirit who do not like to work under someone else, because they are unaware of their&nbsp;strength. They can be neither successful in business nor in any profession.</P>
      
      <P>And the same is true even in the field&nbsp;of social service - often volunteers do not want to work under someone else. This is merely an exhibition of their weakness. With such an attitude, they achieve very little.</P>
      
      <P>One who is timid and weak in spirit would be uncomfortable to work even under the Wise one; but one who knows his own strength can work effectively even under a fool!</P>
      
      <P>Nityanand: But to work under a fool is frustrating!</P>
      <P>SriSri: When you know your strength, with skill and intelligence, you can turn every disadvantage into an advantage. A fool can bring out the best of your communication skills! (laughter)</P>
      
      <P>So watch out! If you feel uncomfortable working under someone, it clearly shows you need to strengthen yourself. Desiring freedom from circumstances, situations or people is no freedom at all. Knowing that nobody can take away your freedom Ö that is strength! And when you realize your strength is unshakable, you would not mind working under anybody.</P>

      <P>A commitment can only be felt when it oversteps convenience. That which is convenient, you do not call commitment. If you just go on your convenience, your commitment falls apart causing more inconvenience! If you keep dropping your commitment because it is inconvenient, can you be comfortable? Often, what is convenient does not bring comfort, but gives an illusion of comfort. Also if you are too stuck in commitment, and it is too inconvenient too often, you will be unable to fulfill your commitment and it will only generate frustration. Wisdom is to strike a balance between convenience and commitment because both bring comfort to the body, mind and spirit. </P>

      <P>A seeker of knowledge should forget about convenience, so should soldiers, rulers, students, seekers of wealth and all essential service providers. Those who want to be creative and adventurous transcend convenience. Those who are ambitious and have a passion for a goal do not care for convenience. To the wise their commitment is their comfort. Whenever their commitment is shaken, their comfort is also shaken. To the lazy, commitment is torture though it is the best remedy. </P>

      <LI>Commitment to the means can be given up for the sake of the commitment to the goals.</LI>

      </B>When someone blames you, you feel a heavy load on your head, and when you talk about it you spread the unpleasant feeling all around you. At this moment wake up and see you are Being and nothing can touch you. This is all just a drama, which you yourself have created. You have gone through this over and over again. All the blames you face in your life are your own creation. Knowing this, you feel free and light.<BR>
      <BR>
      Owning responsibility for all your experiences in life makes you powerful and will put an end to grumbling, planning counter attacks, explanations, and all those host of negative tendencies. Owning full responsibility you become free. <BR>
      <BR>
      When someone blames you, directly or indirectly, what do you do?<BR>
      <BR>
      Do you register it in your mind and get emotionally upset?<BR>
      Do you dismiss them altogether without taking a lesson from it?<BR>
      Do you talk about it with people and waste your time and otherÒ³ time and money?<BR>
      Do you pity yourself and blame your shortcomings?<BR>
      Do you blame the other person right, left and center?<BR>
      Do you generalize and eternalize the problem? <BR>
      <BR>
      Then you are not living up to the knowledge. You need to do the basic course at least half a dozen times and read all the previous knowledge sheets.<BR>
      <BR>
      Do you laugh at it and not even take notice of it?<BR>
      Do you treat it as a non-event, not even worth talking about, let alone taking any action? <BR>
      Do you treat comments and accusations as passing clouds and more of an entertainment?<BR>
      Do you discourage dwelling on unpleasant and negative moments?<BR>
      Do you remain non-judgmental and absolutely unshaken in your space of love? <BR>
      Outwardly you may be calm, but do you also remain centered and calm within you and not even take pride in your growth or wisdom? <BR>
      <BR>
      Then you are a pride to your tutor - the Master.</P>

      To love someone because they love you, you get zero marks.<BR>

      <P>NEWS FLASH </B> <br/> A gentleman complained to Guruji about how some people have ganged up against him and blame him. Guruji gave a patient hearing, with a few comments in between. The person felt he gained some sympathy and as he started feeling righteous, Guruji shot back saying, &quot;You have already wasted enough of your time. Why do you want to waste mine also! You only get what you have sown!&quot;<BR>
     
      Suddenly the whole atmosphere became serene and smiles returned.</P>

      <P><BR>
      </B>Ambition indicates lack of self-confidence!</P>
      
      <P>When you know you can achieve something easily, you are not ambitious about it.  You are simply confident about it. Your ambition indicates challenge and uncertainty, which is contrary to self-confidence. So one you has total self-confidence cannot be ambitious!!</P>
      
      <P>At the same time a person who lacks total self-confidence cannot be ambitious either!!</P>
      
      <P>For ambition to be, one must have a little bit of confidence and total ignorance of the Self. </P>
      
      <P>It is next to impossible to have total confidence without  Self-knowledge. </P>
      
      <P>With the knowledge of the Self, there is nothing left to achieve, for the entire nature of existence is mere</P>
      <P>play and display of one's own consciousness. </P>
      
      <P>People take pride in being ambitious. The wise man will only smile at them.  Ambition can never be for</P>
      <P>something you know you can achieve effortlessly. You can only be ambitious about something for which you have to put effort, which poses a challenge and of which you are not even certain you will be able to achieve or not. </P>
      
      <P>Moreover it takes away the joy of the moment.</P>
      
      <P>With the Self-knowledge nothing is challenging to you, nor you need to put any effort. Nature is ready to</P>
      <P>fulfill your intention even before they arise, giving you no chance to crave or desire. Nature does not</P>
      <P>allow the wise to have a desire (ambition), and the unwise to fulfill or get rid of the desire (ambition).</P>
      <P> </P>
      
      <P>Do you still want to be ambitious ?? Or is your only ambition is to get rid of ambition !!</P>

      <P>Belongingness can bring about a host of negative emotions. Like demand, jealousy, unawareness and lack of gratitude. Just look into your own life, you feel more grateful to strangers than the people you feel "belong" to you. Belongingness reduces gratefulness, awareness, and gives rise to demands which destroys love. This is the biggest problem in relationships. People are nice to strangers and give more attention to them. With a sense of belongingness comes carefreeness and lack of attention.</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><BR>
      </P>
      </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>Look belongingness can make you insensitive, dull, and take away the charm in life!</P>
      <P>Anyway, who belongs to whom in this world? Here you are a stranger and everyone is a stranger to you!</P>
      <P>Blessed are those who feel themselves as a stranger!</P>
      <P>You feel more obligation to a stranger than the person you feel belongs to you. Obligation is very good to keep a check on your ego. It makes you humble. There is no greater antidote to ego than humility. Being humble is the beginning of all virtues.</P>
      <P>People have such resistance for obligations. They do not realize that they are always under obligations, whether giving or taking! Dull people think that one is obliged only when one takes. The wise knows that even when one is giving one is under obligations, as the person has accepted what one gives. So whether you give or take you are under obligations. And if someone does not give or take, you are still under obligation! For they are freeing you from visible obligations!!</P>
      <P>That is to say, you are obliged to all those who do not make you obliged!!! A Got it? </P>
      <P>Life (you) renews itself everytime by becoming a stranger in this old and familiar world.</P>
      <P>You are simply loaded with obligations and you are a total stranger in this world every moment!</FONT><FONT SIZE=3>&#9;</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>LIFE IS A DREAM, A BURDEN OR A JOKE</B></P>
      
      <P>(Continued from last week's Knowledge sheet)<BR>
        <BR>
        Often when you are happy you feel life is a dream because you do not believe in the reality of it.&nbsp; When there is misery you feel life as a burden.&nbsp; And we take trivial things very seriously.&nbsp; But one who has really gone through the pleasure realizes that pleasure is a burden.&nbsp; And if you have undergone misery thoroughly you will realize that life is a dream.&nbsp; In every miserable condition you have been walked or carried through and you realize life is a dream.&nbsp; When you see life is dream a burden or a joke only then can you be centered.<BR>
        <BR>
        And when you have really gone through misery you have really seen life as a dream.&nbsp; And in between the pain and pleasure life is all a joke.<BR>
        <BR>
        Life is very uncertain.&nbsp; Before it takes you away, realize it is a dream, a burden or a joke.&nbsp; <BR>
        <BR>
        Someone asked:&nbsp; What about life is a joke?&nbsp; </P>
        <P>Answer:&nbsp; A joke you do not question.&nbsp; If you question a joke, it is no longer a joke.&nbsp; Do not question a burden either.&nbsp; It is a waste of time to question life and its events.&nbsp; <BR>
        <BR>
        The burden makes you go deep.&nbsp; It gets you to the core of yourself.&nbsp; <BR>
        <BR>
        Realization of a dream wakes you up.&nbsp; And seeing life as a joke makes you light. <BR>
        <BR>
        The only certainty is that life is a dream, a burden or a joke and only when you realize this can you be centered.</P> 		</font>

      <FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Reason is reeling in the known. Faith is moving in the unknown.<BR>
        Reason is repetition. Faith is exploration.<BR>
        Reason is routine. Faith is adventure.</P>
        <P>They are completely opposite, yet an integral part of life.</P>
        
        <P>Not having faith itself is misery; faith gives instant comfort. While reasoning keeps you sane and grounded, no miracle can happen without faith. Faith takes you beyond limitations. In faith you can transcend the laws of nature but it needs to be pure. Faith is beyond reason, yet you need to have faith in your own reasoning! (A sentence to be pondered on.) Faith and reason cannot exist without each other. Every reason is based on some faith. Whenever reason or faith breaks, confusion and chaos prevails which is often a step for growth.</P>
        
        <P>There are two types of faith. Faith out of fear, greed and insecurity; and faith born out of love like the faith between the mother and the child, the Master and disciple.  Whereas the faith out of love cannot be broken, faith out of fear and greed is shaky.</P>
        
        <P>An atheist bases himself on reason, and a believer on faith. A believer uses God as an insurance policy! He thinks he is special. In the eyes of God there is no &quot;mine&quot; and &quot;others&quot;; all are the same. An atheist rationalizes to keep his eyes shut to reality. Death shakes them both! When someone close dies, an atheist eyes are opened, and a believerÒ³ faith cracks. Only a Yogi - a wise one - remains unshaken. For that person has transcended both reason and faith.</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>DOING TRIVIAL THINGS</B></P>
      
      <P>What is that you can do for eternity? Definitely not anything that is big or great because it needs effort and effort tires you. So, it is a temporary state. If you can think of one thing that is way below your capacity to do and agree to do it for eternity, that becomes Pooja.<BR>
        <BR>
        The readiness to consciously do trivial things for eternity unites you with eternity. This is an antidote to ego. Ego is always ambitious and wants to do the toughest job like climbing Mount Everest etc. Whereas in a simple act like watching a butterfly, watering the garden, watching the birds or the sky, can bring deep relaxation, and relaxation connects you with your source. Not that you do trivial things all your life, but consciously agreeing to do the trivial actions for eternity, opens a new dimension and brings in immense peace and restfulness.<BR>
        <BR>
        To find rest in activity, choose an activity that is far below your capacity and agree to do it until eternity. Doing a job far below your capacity and being satisfied with it will make it possible to do a job much beyond your capacity.<BR>
        <BR>
        Know that all actions are born out of infinity and that which is born out of infinity can take you to infinity. </P> 		</font>

      <P>This conviction or experience that &quot;only God exists&quot; is Samadhi. Samadhi is the mother of all talents, strengths and virtues. Samadhi is needed even for the most materialistic person because a materialistic person looks to gain strength and virtues. To be in Samadhi you do not need any effort or talents, strengths or virtues.</P>
      
      <P>Withdrawing from all types of physical and mental activity is rest. That is in-built in our system as sleep, and sleep is the best friend of activity. Samadhi is a conscious rest. Samadhi is the best friend of life. To be alive in your full potential, Samadhi is indispensable. </P>
      
      <P>What obstructs Samadhi is restlessness. How many types of restlessness are there and what are the remedies? ... The answers next week.</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>FIVE TYPES OF RESTLESSNESS</B></P>
      
      <P>There are five types of restlessness.</P>

      <P>The first type of restlessness is due to the place you are in. When you move away from that place, the street or the house, you immediately feel better. Chanting, singing, children playing and laughing can change this atmospheric restlessness. If you chant and sing, the vibration in the place changes.</P>
      
      <P>The second type of restlessness is in the body. Eating the wrong food or vata aggravating food, eating at odd times, not exercising, and overworking can all cause a physical restlessness. The remedy for this is exercise, moderation in work habits and going on a vegetable or juice diet for one or two days.</P>
      
      <P>The third type of restlessness is mental restlessness. It is caused by ambition, strong thoughts, likes or dislikes. Knowledge alone can cure this restlessness. Seeing life from a broader perspective, knowledge about the Self and the impermanence of everything. If you achieve everything, so what? After your achievement, you will die. Knowledge of your death or life, confidence in the Self, in the Divine, can all calm down the mental restlessness.</P>
      
      <P>Then there is emotional restlessness. Any amount of knowledge does not help here. Only Kriya helps! All that emotional restlessness vanishes. Also the presence of the Guru, a wise person, or a saint will help to calm your emotional restlessness.</P>
      
      <P>The fifth type of restlessness is rare. It is the restlessness of the soul. When everything feels empty and meaningless, know you are very fortunate. That longing and restlessness is the restlessness of the soul. Do not try to get rid of it. Embrace it! Welcome it! Usually to get rid of it people do all sorts of things - they change places, jobs or partners, do this, do that. It seems to help for some time, but it does not last.</P>
      
      <P>This restlessness of the soul alone can bring authentic prayer in you. It brings perfection, Siddhis and miracles in life. It is so precious to get that inner most longing for the Divine.  Satsang, the presence of the enlightened one, soothes the restlessness of the soul.</P> 		</font>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>TENDENCIES AND INFLUENCES</B></P>
      
      <P>Life moves by dual (two) factors: inner tendencies and outer influences.</P>

      <P>Inner tendencies form your attitudes and behavior, while external influences makes strong impressions in your mind. Often your tendencies generate external situations. And situations around you can form tendencies within you. This is what is called Karma. Both these factors -  the tendencies from within and influences from outside, can either be beneficial or harmful.</P>
      
      <P>It is the awareness that filters the outer negative influences and it is the awareness that corrects and annihilates the unhealthy inner tendencies. This awareness is called Gyana. The purpose of education is to develop this awareness, so that you can be selective about your tendencies and influences.</P>
      
      <P>It is practically impossible to resist the external influences and the inner tendencies without raising one's consciousness. This can be gradual or sudden. And that is how a human being has both free will and destiny.</P>
      
      <P>Freedom is when you have a say about your tendencies and your influences. And only awareness and impeccable devotion can bring this freedom.</P>

      <P>&nbsp;Authenticity and skillfulness appear to be contradictory, but in fact they are complementary. Your intentions need to be authentic and your actions need to be skillful. The more authentic the intention, the more skillful the action will be. Authentic intention and skillful action make you unshakable. </P>
<P>&nbsp;Skill is required only when authenticity cannot have its way. Yet skill without authenticity makes you shallow. You cannot have an authentic action and a skillful intention. If you try to be authentic in your action but manipulative in your mind, that is when mistakes happen.</P> <P>&nbsp;John: Is it possible to have a powerful intention, like greed, that is authentic?</P> <P>Sri Sri: If your intention is colored by greed, over-ambition, etc. then your intention is not authentic. Whenever your intentions are impure, it pricks your consciousness, so it cannot be authentic. Authentic intentions are free from negative emotions. An action that is not skillful leads to negative emotions and an intention that is not authentic harbors negative emotions. </P>
<P>&nbsp;Gayatri: If our intention is authentic and yet our actions are not skillful, what should we do?</P>
<P>Sri Sri: Carry a handkerchief (<I>laughter</I>).</P>
<P>&nbsp;Question: What is the best skill to deal with intention?</P>
<P>Sri Sri: Do not keep any sankalpas (intentions) to yourself. Offer them to the Divine.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Actions can never be perfect but our intentions can be perfect. Actions always have room for improvement. Action means growth and movement, and that needs space.</P>
<P>&nbsp;The depth in you and the freedom in you bring out all the skillfulness in you. Krishna was the most skillful because his silence was so deep. </P> 		</font>

      <P>Become God to each other. Do not look for God somewhere in the sky, but see God in every pair of eyes, in the mountains, water, trees and animals. How? Only when you see God in yourself. Only Gods can worship Gods. To recognize divinity, there are three dimensions: time, space and mind.</P>
      <P>For a seeker, it is necessary to honor time and space so he or she can experience sacredness in his or her mind. When you honor time and space, your mind becomes alert. But for the one who has transcended the mind, either sacredness has no meaning, or all time, every place and every mood is sacred.</P>
      
      <P>Precious moments are few in life. Catch them and treasure them. Place, time, mood of mind are factors that influence celebration. Snatch every opportunity to celebrate, then you feel great and full. Then celebration infiltrates your mind in all moods and space, and celebration is inevitable. Celebration reminds you of the fullness of the moment. The moments you are in the company of knowledge - the Master - are the most precious moments in your life. Treasure them. Treasuring them you transcend the mind, time and space. And that is true celebration.</P> 		</font>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>MISTAKES</B></P>
      
      <P>Mistakes keep happening all the time. Often you get irritated by them and want to correct them. How much can you correct?&nbsp; There are two situations when you correct other's mistakes:</P>

<P>1. You correct someone's mistake because it bothers you. But even if you correct it, this does not work.</P>
<P>2. You correct someone's mistake, not because it bothers you, but for their sake so that they can grow.</P>

<P>To correct mistakes you need authority and love. Authority and love seem to be contradictory, but in reality they are not. Authority without love is stifling and does not work. Love without authority is shallow. A friend needs to have both authority and love but they need to be in the right combination. This can happen if you are totally dispassionate and centered.&nbsp; </P>

<P>When you allow room for mistakes, you can be both authoritative and sweet. That is how the Divine is, the right balance of both. Krishna and Jesus had both. People, when they are in love, exercise authority with each other. Authority and love exist in all relationships.</P>

<P>Abhay says, "The husband just loves and the wife has authority."</P>

<P>Mikey asks, "Is that a mistake?"</P>

<P>Guruji says, "I don't want to correct it!&quot; (laughter)</P> 		</font>

So, to the one who has tasted pleasure in rest (Samadhi), the pleasure in activity is insignificant. All activities that you do, you do so that you can have deep rest. Activity is part of the system. However, the real pleasure is in Samadhi. In order to have deep rest, one must be active. The proper balance of both is essential. Many seek pleasure in this or that but the wise man just smiles. The real rest is only in knowledge.</P> 		</font>

      <P>When your feelings dominate, worry dissolves.</P>
      
      <P>If you worry a lot, your feelings are dead; you are stuck in the head. Worrying makes your mind and heart inert and dull. Worries are like a rock in the head. Worry entangles you.&nbsp; Worry puts you in a cage.</P>
      
      <P>When you feel, you do not worry.</P>
      
      <P>Feelings are like flowers, they come up, they blossom and they die. Feelings rise, they fall and then disappear. When feelings are expressed, you feel relieved. When you are angry, you express your anger and the next moment you are all right.&nbsp; Or you are upset, you cry and you get over it.</P>
      
      <P>Feelings last for some short time and then they drop, but worry eats at you for a longer period of time, and eventually eats you up.</P>
      
      <P>Feelings make you spontaneous.&nbsp; Children feel, so they are spontaneous. Adults put brakes on their feelings and they start worrying.&nbsp; Worrying about anything obstructs action while feelings propel action.&nbsp; Worrying about negative feelings is a blessing because it puts the brakes on those feelings, preventing you from acting on them.&nbsp; Usually one never worries about positive feelings.&nbsp; Worries are uncertain.&nbsp; Worrying takes away your energy; you cannot think clearly when you worry.</P>
      
      <P>Offering your worries is prayer and prayer moves you in feelings.</P>
      
      <P>When you think you are feeling too much then you start worrying about your feelings.&nbsp; Let's not worry about it and feel our food!</P> 		</font>

Not having a master was looked down upon as being an orphan, being poor and a sign of misfortune. The word "anatha" in Sanskrit, means one without a master. Those without a master were considered to be orphans, but not those without parents.</P>

<P>But in the Occident, having a master is considered a matter of shame and a sign of weakness, for masters are known for enslaving people.</P>

<P>In the Orient people take pride in having a guru and there is a guru for every discipline - a religious guru (dharma), a family guru (kula), a rajguru (guru for the kingdom), a vidyaguru (guru for a particular discipline) and a satguru (spiritual guru).</P>

<P>In the Orient, masters made you feel powerful; in the Occident, masters made you weak.</P>

<P>In the Orient, there was a deep sense of belongingness that would enable one to dissolve the limited identity into infinity. But in the Occident, a master was a motivator and one who provoked competition.</P> 		</font>

        <P>So, the subtler you become, the more authority you gain.</P>
        <P>The greater the love, subtler will be the authority.</P>

      <P>The whole universe is nothing but groups of atoms, groups of quality, of energy. Gana means group and a group cannot exist without a lord.

      <P>This Ganesha, or the lord, was born from the unmanifest transcendental consciousness, the Self, called Shiva.</P>

      <P>Why are people hungry for power?</P>

<P>People are hungry for power because they want attention and recognition. </P>

<P>Power is a means, just like money. Passion is for an end. People who do not see power or money as a means, but see it as an end in itself, they do not live, they simply exist.</P>

<P>If you do not realize that you are THE power -- that is to say that you are enlightened, then you crave for power. </P>
<P>&#9;</P>
<P>You crave for attention and recognition if:</P>
<P> </P>
<OL>

<LI>You don't have any talents, </LI>
<LI>You have no love or passion, </LI>
<LI>You are not innocent and childlike.</LI></OL>

<P> </P>
<P>If you don't have any talent and you are not contributing anything substantial to society, like an artist or a scientist, or an Art of Living teacher or volunteer, then you are hungry for power.</P>

<P>If you don't have love or passion to bring about transformation in the society, then you are hungry for power.</P>

<P>If you are not innocent and childlike and don't have a sense of belongingness with the whole world, then you are hungry for power.</P>

<P>Those who do not have any of these four, like some politicians, crave for power.</P>

<P>The true power is the power of the spirit; real confidence, strength and happiness all spring from the spirit. And one who knows this and has this is not hungry for power at all. </P> 		</font>

      <P>Man has a tendency to own things. When he owns something small his mind stays small, his life gets stifled and his whole consciousness is immersed in his house, car, spouse, children and such. A recluse leaves his home and goes far away. There also he starts owning his asana, rosary, books, concepts and his knowledge. </P>

<P>The owning has simply shifted from objects and people to ideas and practices. But a wise one knows that he owns the sun, the moon, the stars, the air, all of space and the Divine in its entirety. When you own something big then your consciousness also expands, and when you own something small then all the small negative emotions start coming up such as anger, greed, etc. </P>

<P>I wonder why people do not feel connected to the sun? The very existence of life depends upon the sun. Perhaps it is the lack of awareness that one refuses to acknowledge and own one's connectedness to the macro-cosmic universe. The Rishis in ancient India, the Native Americans and the aboriginals from all over the globe have insisted that you can feel connection to the sun, moon and the directions. </P>

<P>When you own something magnanimous your consciousness also becomes magnanimous. </P>

<P>(Next week's Knowledge will be on REVERENCE AND OWNERSHIP.)</P>

After brief satsangs in Purwanoo and Solan, Guruji arrived at Simla, a famous hill station, to a moving traditional welcome with horns, music and dances. At Simla, Guruji addressed the senior bureaucrats of the state government at the state guest house. On the following day was a Maha Kriya and a big satsang attended by thousands.</P>
<P ></P>
<P>Onward to Uttar Pradesh, the largest state of India, where Guruji was again invited as a state guest to the state capital Lucknow. He was received there by an enthusiastic crowd of several thousand. His address to the prominent people of Lucknow was laced with wit and humor. Guruji gifted cycles, wheel-chairs and hearing aids to 500 physically-challenged. Several thousand were blissed out in the evening satsang.</P>
<P ></P>
<P >Guruji returned to Delhi for yet another blissful satsang with thousands of devotees. Also on the agenda was an inspiring address to over 5,000 village youth at a conference attended by Ms. Uma Bharati, Minister for Youth in India.</P>
<P ></P>
<P >It was a whirlwind tour, and it was as if an Art of Living wave swept across all the cities that Guruji visited!</P>

      <P>Worst Act of Reason is War.</P>

<P>Every war has a reason, and the reason justifies the war. Those who engage in war, reason it out. But reason is limited. As reason changes, justification falls apart.</P>

<P>All the reasons for every war appear to be justifiable to some limited minds and for limited time. Hence, war becomes inevitable on this planet.</P>

<P>War is limited to human beings. No other species in creation engage in war or mass destruction, as they have no reason. Animals have their prey and let everything just be. But mankind, from time immemorial, has been engaging in war because Man lives on reason. Man gives reason to every act of his and justifies it. As reasons change, his justifications fall apart.</P>

<P>Man has to transcend reason, and only then can he realize the Divinity. Then he does not engage in war. Only when people become sensible, rise above hatred and have heightened consciousness can the war be stopped.</P> 		</font>

<P>In this week alone..</P>
<P>Guruji was the state guest of four different Indian states - Meghalaya, Assam, West Bengal and Tripura! Estimated crowds of over 250,000 people have taken darshan and blessings of Guruji! Estimated crowds of over 35,000 people have done Sudarshan Kriya with Guruji!</P>

<P>At Calcutta, Guruji addressed delegates of the Calcutta Chamber of Commerce with His Holiness the Dalai Lama. The evening Satsang had 30,000 people rapt in meditation and blissfully singing bhajans. Memorable yagnyas were performed at Calcutta and Guwahati for harmony in the world.</P>

<P>Guwahati welcomed Guruji with beautiful Assamese Bihu songs and dance sequences. Guruji emphasized the need to protect the rich and diverse Assamese culture. Thousands braved the rains to be in the evening Satsang. Guruji inaugurated the Sri Sri Ravi Shankar Vidya Mandir (school) at Guwahati by ringing the bell. After a cruise on the river Brahmaputra, the entourage left for Siliguri for less than a 24-hour stay!</P>

<P>Siliguri, a town in the foothill of the Darjeeling, (close to Nepal, Bhutan and Sikkim), celebrated His arrival with all roads leading to the Mega Satsang. Guruji's entourage had no risk of getting lost, as any resident of the town could guide them to Guruji's place of residence and Satsang! The Maha Kriya in the morning had thousands doing the Sudarshan Kriya with Guruji, while the Mega Satsang had over 50,000 people singing, dancing and celebrating the grace of Guruji. At Siliguri, Guruji graced the Sri Sri Ravi Shankar Vidya Mandir and inaugurated the Rural Training Centre in the Siliguri Ashram premises.

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>TERRORISM: THE CAUSE AND THE REMEDY</B></P>
      
      <P>The act which is only destructive and inflicts suffering both on oneself and others is terrorism. In such an act, human values are lost in the process of achieving a goal.</P>

      <P>Some of the factors that lead to terrorism are:</P>
      
      <UL>
      <LI>Frustration and desperation to achieve a goal</LI>
      <LI>Confused emotion</LI>
      <LI>Shortsightedness and Impulsive action</LI>
      <LI>Belief in a non-verifiable concept of heaven and merit; a childish concept of God favoring some and angry at others, thereby undermining the omniscience and omnipotence of the Divine.</LI></UL>
      
      
      <P>Terrorism induces fear psychosis in all, increases poverty, suffering and loss of life with no apparent gains. Instead of solutions the terrorist looks for destruction as an answer. If you simply criticize without giving a solution, know that this criticism comes from the same seed as terrorism! </P>
      
      <P>Although there are certain qualities you can appreciate in a terrorist such as:</P>
      
      <UL>
      <LI>Fearlessness </LI>
      <LI>Commitment to a goal</LI>
      <LI>Sacrifice</LI></UL>
      
      
      <P>You will have to learn from them things that you should never do:</P>
      
      <UL>
      <LI>Valuing some ideas and concepts more than life. </LI>
      <LI>Having a narrow perspective of life and dishonoring its diversity.</LI></UL>
      
      
      <P>The Remedy for terrorism is:</P>
      
      <UL>
      <LI>Inculcate a broader perspective of life -- value life more than race, religion and nationality.</LI>
      <LI>Educate people  in human values - friendliness, compassion, cooperation and upliftment.</LI>
      <LI>Teach methods to release stress and tension.</LI>
      <LI>Cultivate confidence in achieving noble aims by peaceful and nonviolent means. </LI>
      <LI>Create spiritual upliftment which can weed out destructive tendencies. </LI></UL>
      
      
      <P>Question: Can it be that terrorism need not be only physical violence, but also cultural or economical?</P>
      
      <P>Sri Sri: Yes.</P>
      <P>Solution for economic violence - &quot;Think globally, buy locally.&quot; </P>
      <P>Solution for cultural violence - &quot;Broaden your vision, deepen your roots.&quot;</P>
      
      <P>Question: How does one cope with the aftermath of terrorism?</P>
      
      <P>Sri Sri: Faith and prayer. When disaster happens, anger is inevitable. To take precautions that one does not react wisdom is needed, not emotional outbursts. One mistake cannot be corrected by another mistake. Strive for multi-cultural and multi-religious education and spiritual upliftment to reach every part pf the globe. For the world will not be safe even if a small pocket of people are left ignorant. </P> 		</font>

      <P>Today many are anxious about how to deal with their anxiety!</P>

<P>Here are some of the ways you can manage your anxiety:</P>

<P>1. Sing, dance and celebrate. The very intention to celebrate will pull you away from anxiety to a more harmonious state.</P>
<P>2. Think about what you can do for others rather than just about yourself. Energize yourself with some service activity.</P>
<P>3. Combined practice of yoga, breathing and meditation.</P>
<P>4. Know the impermanence of the world.</P>
<P>5. Having faith and surrendering to the Divine and knowing that there is a supreme power who loves you. The supreme power is behind you and accepts you totally. The sense of security comes with the sense of belongingness.</P>
<P>6. Valour/courage: Invoking the lion within you and having an attitude of sacrifice will rescue you from anxiety.</P>
<P>7. Reminding yourself that you are committed to a greater goal will keep the anxiety away.</P>
<P>8. Being unpredictable for a while. Anxiety is always related to some anticipated action. Do something completely irrelevant and unpredictable.</P>
<P>9. Readiness to face the worst will leave you with stability in the mind.</P>
<P>10. Remembering a similar situation in the past when you were able to overcome your anxiety.</P>

<P>Chanakya : If none of theses work just come and be in the presence of the Master. (laughter)</P> 		</font>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>DROP YOUR INTENTIONS</B></P>
      
      <P>A strong tendency to keep doing something, whether important or unimportant, becomes an impediment to meditation. Doing starts first with an intention and then translates into action. Though intention springs from the Being, when it becomes doing it doesn't let you settle down. All intentions, good or bad, trivial or important, need to be dropped for meditation to happen.</P>

<P>Vijay: But isn't dropping all intentions itself an intention?</P>

<P>Sri Sri: Yes, but that intention is the last and necessary intention. Dropping the intentions is not an act – just the intention to drop the intentions itself serves the purpose. Dropping all intentions even for a moment brings you in touch with your Self – that instant meditation happens.</P>
<P>While you sit for meditation you have to let the world be the way it is. The repetition of meditation is to habituate our system to be able to stop  and start activity at will. The ability to do this consciously is a very precious skill.</P> 		</font>

<P>Navaratri saw unmitigated joy with devotees from all over the world. Guruji emerged from silence more even radiant, more profound. Many saints visited the ashram during the Poojas. A renowned saint from Rishikesh gave discourses on the Bhagvatam daily. Yagyas were performed for the health, happiness and well being of people all over the world, which would also contribute to establishing peace everywhere.</P>

<P>Blessings are always special, but the ecstasy experienced by one and all on Rishi Homa (the last day of Navaratri) as Guruji enthusiastically rushed into the crowds, spraying all His devotees with the Holy waters, was without parallel!</P></FONT>

      <P>Who is a volunteer? One who comes to help, without being asked to help; one who is self-motivated, inspired, becomes a volunteer.</P>
<P>There is the possibility of the inspirational motivation going down in a volunteer, which could bring frustration. </P>
<P>Usually volunteers come from the space of demand rather than humility - this dilutes the quality.</P>
<P>Another slack that could happen to a volunteer is that they could slip away from commitment, thinking there is no 'boss' - "If I like it, I do it; if I don't like it, I don't!"  It is like the steering wheel of a car - if all the tires say they do not need steering, then the car cannot run smoothly. If you want to construct a building, you have to accept the authority of the structural engineer.</P>
<P>All these can only be overcome by being more grounded in spiritual knowledge. A volunteer devoid of spiritual dimension is utterly weak.</P>
<P>
1) A volunteer needs to stick to his commitment.<BR>
2) The integrity in a volunteer comes from spiritual practices.<BR>
3) The authority needs to be acknowledged.<BR>
4) The strength of a volunteer comes from the challenges he is ready to willingly face.<BR>
5) A volunteer moves beyond boundaries as he finds he is capable of doing so many things he never ever thought of doing.<BR>
6) A true volunteer does not expect appreciation or reward.<BR>
7) A volunteer has such a joy - that joy, itself, comes as the reward.<BR>
8) If a volunteer thinks he is obliging somebody, he is thoroughly mistaken. He is 'volunteering' because he derives so much joy out of it.</P>

<P>The joy is immediate - it does not come on the first of every month in the form of a salary!</P>
<P>When a volunteer realizes this, he is filled with gratitude.</P>
<P>When a volunteer waivers from within, the support system is knowledge and good friends.</P> 		</font>

      <P>The fourth type is done out of your desire for merit - you do seva expecting some benefit in the future.</P>
      
      <P>And the fifth type is when you do seva just to show off, to improve your image and to gain social or political recognition. Such seva is simply exhausting, while the first type does not bring any tiredness at all!</P>

<LI>When you see your life from a bigger context of time and space, then you realize your life is nothing.</LI>

<LI>When you are humble you need to see that you are unique and dear to the Divine, which brings confidence, and when you realize you are insignificant, that brings confidence.</LI>

<LI>When you have a guru, you cannot be arrogant. Your guru gives you confidence and also brings humility in you. The weakness in humility and the arrogance in confidence are removed.</LI></OL>

Immense numbers of legal cases have been withdrawn from courts, with warring factions agreeing to peaceful settlements, especially those involving &quot;under-privileged&quot; classes. Homes are being given to the needy, Sri Sri Ravishankar Vidya Mandirs opened where schools are not available. Tulsi, neem, genda, and other trees are being planted around homes and throughout villages.

        <P>1. Respect that comes to you because of your position, fame or wealth. This type of respect is impermanent. It can be lost once you lose your wealth or status.</P>

        <P>The less you are attached to your virtues, the more self respect you have. If you get attached to your virtues, you look down upon everybody else and they (the virtues) start diminishing. Non- attachment to virtues brings the highest self respect.</P>
        
        <P>Often one confuses ego with self esteem. Ego needs the other for comparision, self esteem is just confidence in oneself.

        <P>Ego simply means lack of respect to the Self.</P>

      <P>&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Arial">What is Maya?</P>

        <P>Maya is that which can be measured. The whole world can be measured, that is why it is Maya. All the five elements - Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Ether - can be measured.</P>
        </FONT>
        <FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Question: Can space be measured?</P>
        </FONT>
        <FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Sri Sri: Only in space can things be measured. Space is the first dimension of measurement.</P>
        <P>Measurement is always relative and not absolute. Example: If something weighs 6 kilos on the earth, it then weighs only 1 kilo on the moon. The light of the star you see today is not really today's light. It has taken at least 4 years for the light to reach you! Both size and weight change in air, water and earth. So &quot;measure&quot; is illusive and not dependable. Your bones, skin, body, environment and five elements can be measured; you can put a value to it. So, the whole world is Maya!</P>
        </FONT>
        <FONT FACE="Arial"><P>All measures are&nbsp;relative understanding. Einstein's theory of relativity correlates with the Advaita (non-dual) philosophy.</P>
        </FONT>
        <FONT FACE="Arial"><P>&nbsp;But what is not Maya? All that cannot be measured is not Maya. You cannot say 1 ounce of love, 2 ounces of peace, 5 kilos of happiness, Can YOU be measured? It is not possible. Your body has weight, but not YOU. Truth cannot be measured, Ananda (joy) cannot be measured, beauty cannot be measured. All these are part of Consciousness or Easwara (Divine) and are called MAYI.</P>

      <LI>You are not in control when you are sleeping or dreaming.
      <LI>You are not in control of thoughts and emotions coming to you. You may choose to express it or not, but they come to you without your prior permission!

      <P>Similarly, do you think you are in control of all the events in your life or in the world? That is a joke!</P>
      <P>When you look at things from this angle you need not be afraid of losing control, because you have none!</P>
      <P>Whether you realise it or not, when you let go of your sense of control that is when you truly relax. Your identification of being somebody does not let you relax totally and it keeps your domain limited. </P> 		</font>

      <FONT FACE="Arial"><P>It is often believed that glory and dispassion are contradictory and cannot co-exist.  Glory and luxury without dispassion is a nauseating pomp and show.  Such glory does not bring fulfillment for anyone… it is shallow.  Alternately, the dispassion that is afraid of glory is weak.  True dispassion is oblivious to glory.</P>

        <P>The glory that comes with dispassion is something that is true, that is permanent and authentic.  When someone runs after glory they are shallow.  Like movie stars, politicians and religious leaders who try to hold on to their status, to their glory, they are certain to lose.  If you run after glory all you get is misery.  When you are dispassionate, glory comes to you.</P>
        
        <P>If you are afraid of glory, that means you are not well-founded in dispassion.  In India, the Sadhus run away from glory.  They think they will lose their dispassion and get trapped in the web of the world, the circus.  The dispassion is so blissful, they get attached to the dispassion.  (laughter)</P>
        
        <P>They are afraid of losing the dispassion, the centeredness and bliss that comes along with it.  This is weak dispassion.  Dispassion is a state of being and glory is the happening around it.  True dispassion can never be lost or overshadowed by glory.</P>

        <P>Do not put off the fire of longing for the Divine or Satsang with Dispassion. </P>
        
        <P>There is a little fire in you that propels you towards Knowledge, Sadhana, Devotion and Service. Sometimes you use Knowledge to put off that fire. The so-called dispassionate people are often morose and unenthusiastic. Many a times you hear people saying. &quot; Oh, never mind, God is everywhere, Guruji is in my heart, you can do satsang anywhere. My Seva is my Sadhana, so no need to meditate, anyway I am doing Sadhana twenty-four hours. When God wills, he will call me to satsang and advanced courses again!&quot;</P>
        
        <P>Such excuses should not be justified as dispassion.</P>
        
        <P>When you want to do some service, the mind goes,  &quot;Oh, its all Maya, anyway everything is an illusion. It's all just happening. Things will happen when the time comes!&quot;</P>
        
        <P> In this way Knowledge gets misused and is quoted out of context to suit one's convenience or laziness. In the name of dispassion do not lose that spark of  enthusiasm and interest. Using Knowledge like this you miss out a lot. </P>
        
        <P>Keep the fire of longing for the Divine and service to the society alive.   Dispassion here would be detrimental.</P> 		</font>

      <P>Often business is looked down upon by spiritualists and spirituality is put off as non-practical by businessmen.  Spirituality is the heart, business is the legs, and that is what the ancient people conceived.  An individual or a society is incomplete without both these aspects.  Business brings material comfort and spirituality brings mental and emotional comfort.  Spirituality brings ethics and fair practice to business. In the body/mind complex depriving any one comfort means depriving both the comforts.  You cannot talk spirituality to the poorest of the poor people without taking care of their basic needs.  They need to be supported materially.  There is no spirituality in the world that is devoid of service and service cannot happen if material needs are ignored.  Service cannot happen only through the lips. For service to move you need legs. </P>

<P>Every system has its flaws.  As capitalism exploits the poor, socialism dampens individual creativity and entrepreneurial spirit.  Spirituality is the bridge between socialism and capitalism. Spirituality gives the heart to serve to the capitalists and the spirit to innovate to the socialist.  </P> 		</font>

      <P>Humor is the buffer that saves you from humiliation. If you have a good sense of humor you can never be humiliated. And if you refuse to be humiliated you become invincible. Humor brings everyone together, while humiliation tears them apart. In a society torn with humiliation and insult, humor is like a breath of fresh air. A good sense of humor relieves you from fear and anxiety.</P>

<P>Humor should be coupled with care and concern.  Mere humor without care and concern or appropriate action often irritates those who come to you with serious problems.</P>

<P>Humor can keep the spirit high, yet if overdone it leaves a bad taste. <BR>
Humor without wisdom is shallow. <BR>
Humor with wisdom creates an atmosphere of celebration.<BR>
Humor without sensitivity is satire - it comes back to you with more problems. </P>

<p>The wise use humor to bring wisdom and to lighten every situation.<BR>
The intelligent use humor as a shield against humiliation.<BR>
The cruel use humor as a sword to insult others.<BR>
The irresponsible use humor to escape from responsibility.<BR>
And fools take humor too seriously!<BR>
To make an effort to be humorous is nonsensical.<br>

<P>Question: How does one cultivate a sense of humor?</P>

<P>Sri Sri:</P>
<OL>
<LI> Humor is not just words, it is the lightness of your Being. You do not have to read and repeat jokes -- just being cordial and light-hearted brings out authentic humor.
<LI> Taking life itself not too seriously (because you will never come out of it alive!) (Laughter)
<LI> Having a sense of belongingness with everybody, including those who are not friendly
<LI> Practicing yoga and meditation
<LI> Having unshakable faith in the Divine, and in the laws of karma
<LI> Being in the company of those who live in knowledge and are humorous
<LI> A willingness to be a clown

      <P>Why would someone tell a lie to their close ones or to their beloved?</P>

      <P>This is a question most often asked by lovers. Since love cannot stand untruth, this causes relationships to break up. The solution lies in understanding the paradox of love and truth.</P>
      
      <P>&nbsp;People tell lies just to save and maintain their love. The fear that the truth might damage their love causes lies to be told between husband and wife, boyfriend and girlfriend, parents and children and in family situations.</P>
      
      <P>In love you feel weak and truth brings strength. Yet why do people prefer love over truth, i.e. weakness over strength?! (laughter)</P>
      
      <P>&nbsp;No one wants to sacrifice love. Thus people are ready to give up the truth for their love. Love takes the luster out of truth. Sometimes truth can make love bitter while in love even lies can appear sweet, like Krishna's lies to his mother Yashoda!</P>
      
      <P>The truth that does not nourish love has no sense and the love that cannot withstand the truth is not true love. When one is assured that the love is so strong that the truth can neither break it nor cause bitterness, then the truth prevails and love shines. </P>
      
      <P>Truth has judgments, but true love is beyond judgments. Thus true love makes you weak and yet it is the greatest strength. </P> 		</font>

      </B><P>Bliss reigned supreme in the beautiful South Indian state of Kerala. Over a million hearts were stolen by Sri Sri during His tour of Kerala.  Everywhere He went, the script was the same – overflowing stadiums, inspiring and scintillating discourses, deep meditations, tears of gratitude. No one could escape! All the events were highlighted in the media. </P>
      
      <P>The Chief Minister of Kerala State and most of his cabinet ministers hosted Sri Sri at a special function and sought His advice on problems that they were facing.</P>
      
      <P>In Thiruvananthapuram, when the participants opened their eyes after Sudarshan Kriya, they could not see Guruji on the stage, though they could hear His voice. Later, they found Him sitting on the branch of a tree with a cordless microphone!</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have always been the center of attention, and are suddenly sidelined, you may feel out of place. Similarly if you have always been on the side lines, and are suddenly pushed to center stage, you may experience restlessness.<br>
If you are used to ordering, and suddenly have to take orders, or, if you usually follow orders, and you are made to give them, you may feel out of place.<br>
A very busy person with nothing to do, or a laid back person who is faced with a lot of responsibilities may experience restlessness.</P>

<P>Very often, feeling out of place blocks the reason and distorts the logic.</P>

<P>If the situation you are in is inevitable, tolerate it. <br>
If it's avoidable, walk out of it.</P>

<P>If you feel that it can expand your abilities, smile through it.</P>

<P>Every awkward situation increases your comfort zone. <br>
Every awkward situation is a test for how deep you are in the Knowledge.</P>

<P>Love something of an awkward situation. This will increase your comfort zone.<br>
When your comfort zone increases, no one will be able to push your buttons and you will become so centered and unshakable.</P> 		</font>

<P>From Bangalore to Bihar - the Master's been busy bowling hearts, beautifying interiors, bestowing Grace!<BR>
 <BR>
From the moment of His tumultuous arrival, Patna opened its heart out. <BR>
The Hathwa Palace brimming over with people, rapturously welcomed Guruji. Evening Satsang was at the Beur Jail where the prisoners had a heart-to-heart chat with&nbsp;Guruji. </P>
<P>
Later, hundreds of students had the benefit of an exclusive session with Him. The Maha Satsang saw over a hundred and fifty thousand people, experiencing His electrifying Presence. </P>

<P>
The next morning Gurudev left for the village, Massauri, which has been the target of numerous terrorist attacks. Thousands who have benefitted from Navchetna Shibirs (Breath Water Sound Workshops) had been preparing for weeks for His visit. Most villagers shared that it was impossible to leave their homes after dusk because of the very volatile and dangerous situation there, but the Shivirs and Satsangs had transformed their lives. </P>


<B><P>Following the Gujarat tragedy, Guruji has requested that everyone observe 2 minutes of silence on Wednesday the 6<SUP>th</SUP> of March 2002, at 9:00 AM local time through out the world for communal peace and harmony and to pay respect to those who have been victims of religious intolerance.</P>

        <P>There were remarkably interesting sessions on the AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences) symposium on the Science of Breath, some of which Guruji Himself chaired. An international team of doctors presented their research findings to more than 1000 delegates. Synopsis and videos will be made available by May.</P>
        <P>Guruji also went to an impromptu Satsang which was organized for Him at Tihar Jail. More than 4000 inmates who had already done the Prison SMART program greeted Him enthusiastically and He went among them and showered flowers of Grace on them.</P>
        <P>He noticed that there were some very old women prisoners there, who could barely sit or stand by themselves, utterly incapable of committing any crimes, and He has made an appeal to the Governor to grant them amnesty.</P>
        <P> He is now in Rishikesh..</P>

<P>The rush to enjoy robs the joy from life. All the rush that you have in your life only denies the joy and freedom of here and now.</P>

<P>Often one does not even know why one is in a hurry. It almost becomes a biological phenomenon to be in a rush. Wake up and become aware of the rush in you!</P>

<P>Anne Farrow says: Wake up and slow down! (Laughter!)</P>

<P>It is ridiculous to be in a rush to slow down. Just being aware of the rush itself will take care of it. Slowing down does not mean lethargy or procrastination. It is easy to be in either extreme of being in a rush or being lethargic. </P>

<P>Feverishness arises out of lack, a need to achieve; whereas dynamism is an expression of fulfillment. </P>

      <FONT FACE="Arial"><P>A pure atheist is impossible to find. An atheist is one who does not believe in anything that is not concrete and tangible. Life is not all concrete and tangible. Nor is this Universe. Whether it is business, science or art, they all involve a certain amount of guesswork, assumptions, imagination and intuition. All of them are ethereal in nature and are not tangible. The moment an atheist accepts, even remotely a field that is unexplainable, he ceases to be an atheist.  Any intelligent person cannot rule out the mystery in life and the universe and hence cannot honestly be an atheist! The so-called atheists are perhaps only denouncing certain concepts of God.   </P>

        <P>Question: Was Buddha an atheist?</P>
        
        <P>Sri Sri: &quot;No&quot; in one sense because he professed emptiness which is very hard for an atheist to accept and &quot;Yes&quot; in another sense because he did not profess concepts of God. </P>

        If you are committed to your family then your family supports you, if you are committed to your society, you enjoy the support of society.  If you are committed to God, God gives you strength.  If you are committed to Truth, Truth brings you strength. </P>
        
        <P>Often one is not aware of this idea and that is why one is hesitant to commit to a greater cause. Also there is a fear that commitment would weaken one or take away one's freedom. Your commitment to a cause is bound to bring you comfort in the long run.</P>

      <P>There are two types of knowledge. 
        The first one is pure knowledge and the second one is applied knowledge.
        Applied knowledge may benefit you directly and immediately but pure knowledge benefits you indirectly in the long run.</P>
        <B><U>
        </B></U><P>If there are some things that you have studied or understood that you are unable to put into practice, do not get disheartened. Sometime in the future, if you do not discard the knowledge you have as impractical, it will be of use to you.</P>
        
        <P>Often people discard the pure knowledge for its lack of immediate application. In fact these two types of knowledge compliment each other. Applied knowledge without pure knowledge remains weak.  And pure knowledge without application will remain unfulfilled.</P>
        
        <P>Do not discard or label the knowledge as impractical. Do not label yourself as weak or unworthy because you are unable to apply the knowledge in your day-to-day life.</P>
        
        <P>Sometimes when you are alone in nature, silent, taking a walk, looking at the sand on the beach, a bird in the sky, or while meditating  – suddenly the knowledge will emerge and you will recognize the knowledge dawning in your life. </P> 		</font>

      <OL>
      
      <LI>You make friendships because you have common enemies.  Fear and threat to survival can bring people together.</LI>
      
      <LI>You make friendships because you have a common problem.  You talk about your problems and become friends.  For example, sickness, job dissatisfaction, etc…</LI>
      
      <LI>People get together because they have common interests.  For example, through business or a profession (doctors, architects, social workers, etc…)</LI>
      
      <LI>You make friends because you have common tastes.  You have similar tastes in sports, movies, entertainment, music, hobbies, etc…</LI>
      
      <LI>People become friends because of compassion and service.  Out of compassion and pity for someone, you become friends with them.</LI>
      
      <LI>People become friends merely because of long-term acquaintance.</LI></OL>
      
      
      <P>Brave are those who nurture friendships for only friendship's sake.  Such friendships will never die nor become soured for it is born out of one's friendly nature.  Only through wisdom can one become friendly by nature.</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>SEVERAL TYPES OF DISPASSION</B></P>
      
      <P>There are several types of dispassion:</P>

      <OL>
      
      <LI>You are dispassionate because you realize the misery in the world.  (You have a fear of misery.)  The events in life -- the pain, the suffering one experiences or sees -- brings dispassion.</LI>
      
      <LI>The second type of dispassion is born out of the desire to reach something higher.  Some consider dispassion as a path to enlightenment.  If you renounce something here you gain something out there. Those who are seeking enlightenment practice austerities and take vows for a better place in heaven.  </LI>
      
      <LI>The third type of dispassion comes out of wisdom or knowledge.  A broader understanding of the transient nature of things brings a state of non-attachment to any events, objects, people or situations that lets you remain calm and unperturbed.</LI></OL>
      
      
      <P>Divine love does not let the dispassion manifest.  The attainment of love brings such bliss and such intoxication, it not only takes away your passion, but dispassion as well.  </P>
      
      <P>This is the problem with Art of Living members.  Many feel they have attained the highest and remain blissed out!  (laughter!)</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>FAITH AND ALERTNESS</B></P>
      
      <P>Faith and alertness appear to be completely opposite in nature. When you are alert, usually there is no faith and you feel restless and insecure. When there is faith the mind is secure and rested and you are not alert.</P>

      <P> There are three types of faith:</P>
      
      <P>Tamasic faith which is because of dullness. Like when you do not want to take responsibility or action and you say, &quot;Oh it doesn't matter, anyway God will take care of all these things!&quot;  (laughter) </P>
      
      <P>Rajasic faith which is brought on by intense compulsion of desires and ambition. The ambition keeps the faith alive. </P>
      
      <P>Satvic faith is innocent and is born out of fullness of consciousness.</P>
      <P> </P>
      <P>Faith and alertness, though apparently opposite in nature, are actually complementary to each other. In the absence of faith there can be no growth, and without alertness there can be no correct understanding. Faith can make you complacent. Alertness makes you tense.</P>
      
      <P>If there is no faith, there is fear. And when there is no alertness one cannot perceive or express properly. A combination of both is essential. </P>
      
      <P>In Gyana (state of wisdom) there is alertness without tension and faith without complacency. The purpose of education should be to remove the element of dullness from faith and the element of fear from alertness. This is a unique and rare combination. If you have faith and alertness at the same time, then you will become a true Gyani (the Wise One)!</P>

      <P>What is enthusiasm? Enthusiasm means to be connected to God within. When you are with your source, you can only be enthusiastic. Apathy is when you are away from the source of life. You cannot be but enthusiastic when your mind is totally in the present moment. </P>

<P>You should know that dispassion is not apathy. It is simply a broader perspective of reality. Dispassion is moving towards the source. Dispassion simply means the way back home. It is the journey towards the source, which is a reservoir of enthusiasm. </P>

<P>When dispassion and enthusiasm co-exist, that is the secret of perennial enthusiasm and profound dispassion. Though they appear to be opposite, they are actually complementary. </P>

      <P>1. What to do if your commitment is boring?</P>
<P>Commitment has value when things are not so charming. When things are interesting you do not need commitment at all. You never say you are committed to doing something that is very interesting or charming.</P>

<P>2. Learning is inevitable. By doing things right you learn, and by doing things wrong you also learn. From every situation, from everybody, you learn either what to do or what not to do. Either by mistakes or by doing things correctly, you cannot but learn. Learning is inevitable.</P>

<P>It is only when you sleep that you do not learn. And if you are asleep in your life, there is neither pain nor pleasure nor learning. Most people are in such deep slumber. That is why many people do not even make an effort to get out of pain.</P>

<P>3. Question: How to improve patience?</P>
<P>Sri Sri: Can I tell you next year?  (Laughter)</P>

<P>4. Question: How to improve memory?</P>
<P>Sri Sri: Ask me this question later.  (Laughter)</P>

      <p>Normally in the world people with similar tendencies group together; intelligent people group together, fools get together, happy people get together, ambitious people get together and disgruntled people also group together to celebrate their problems! (Laughter) There is a saying, "Birds of a feather flock together." </P>

        <p>The disgruntled people get together, they complain and pull each other down. A frustrated person cannot be with someone happy because the other is not dancing to their tune. You only feel comfortable when the other person is in tune with you. Intelligent people do not feel at home with foolish people. Foolish people feel that intelligent ones are not humane. One with wisdom feels at home with the disgruntled as well as the happy, foolish and intelligent. Similarly, people with all these tendencies also feel at home with the wise.</p>

      <P>When people consider the past as free will they are filled with remorse and regret.</P>

<P>When they consider the future as destiny, lethargy and inertia set in.</P>

<P>A wise person will consider the past as destiny and the future as free will.</P>

<P>When you consider the past as destiny, no more questions are raised and the mind is at ease.</P>

<P>And when you consider the future as free will you are filled with enthusiasm and dynamism.</P>

<P>Of course there will be some uncertainty when you consider the future as free will, and some anxiety, but it can also bring alertness and creativity.</P>

<P>Consider the past as destiny, the future as free will and the present moment as Divinity.</P>

<P>Question: How do we remove the anxiety?</P>

<P>Answer: By having faith in the Divine and doing sadhana.</P>
