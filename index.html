    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><br /><hr />THIS BEGINS A NEW PRACTICE</B></P>
    <P>This begins a new practice of weekly dispatches of Knowledge from Guruji. Every center around the world will receive the Knowledge so it can be read for people to copy down at weekly Satsang. Here is the first segment Guruji dictated at Big Sur, 21 June, 1995.</P>
    <P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * *</P>
    <P>Beyond an event is Knowledge.&#9;</P>
    <P>Beyond a person is love.</P>
    <P>Beyond an object is infinity.</P>
    <P>Knowledge is not in an event; it is beyond an event.</P>
    <P>If you take one event and infer anything from one event -- infer knowledge -- it will be erroneous knowledge. Say Nancy gets angry and shouts at someone. You attribute anger to Nancy, but actually it was carried from someone else to her. Someone else got angry first and someone else and someone else and on and on like that.</P>
    <P>When you go beyond an event, only then the truth dawns. One particular event gives you a false notion. So you have to consider the totality of events, the totality of all events infinitely. Beyond the event is Knowledge.</P>
    <P>What do we call a person? A person is a body, a mind, a complex of behaviors which is changing. Love is unchanging. Beyond the person is love.</P>
    <P>When you lose your personality, you become love. If you cannot lose yourself, you cannot find yourself. So, lose your personality; you'll find yourself!!!</P>
    <P>Behind every object is infinity. An object is limited. Take an object and reduce, reduce, reduce, and you have an atom. An atom is infinity. Each atom contains infinite space. Beyond the object is infinity.</P>
    <P>The object behind the object is infinity. The person behind the person is love.</P>
    <P>Maya is getting caught up in the event, personality, object. Knowledge, love, Brahman is seeing beyond the event, personality, or object. See? Just a little shift.</P>

  	<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><br /><hr />CLOSE TO THE MASTER</B></P>
    <P>If you're not feeling close to the Guru, it's because of you. Because of your mind, because of your ego concepts. Share with the Guru that which is very important or intimate to you. Share that. Do not feel shame, shy, or judgmental about yourself. </P>
    <P>Unless you express to the Master that which is very intimate and important to you, just being on the formal and informal communication levels cannot make you feel close. "How are you, where are you going? How have you been?" Stop formal and superficial conversations with the Master and speak with your heart that which is very important and intimate, very deep to your life. Don't just say how much the squash costs, 30 cents or whatever.</P>
    <P>If you don't feel close to the Master, there's no point in having a Master. It is just another burden to you. You have enough already. Just say "Goodbye," get rid of it.</P>
    <P>Question: When you play little games and push us away, how can we feel close to you?</P>
    <P>Answer: You should feel more close if you are pushed away, scolded or ignored. Because to ignore somebody takes a lot of effort. When a Master does not even ignore wrapping paper, or a flower that is in a vase, how can he ignore a walking, talking, breathing human being who is connected? How could that be ignored? So when you understand this, you already feel close.</P>
    <P>Question: Can we call you every week?</P>
    <P>Response from the room: Call Guruji every week and if he doesn't answer the phone then you know you are loved.</P>
    <P>Answer: Yes, put that in. &#9;(Laughter)</P>
    <P>You are with the Master to share the joy of the Master, to share the consciousness of the Master. For that, you have to empty your cup of what is already in it. So you share that with the Master. You share whatever you have and don't judge, "Oh, that is garbage." The Master is ready to accept any garbage of any extent. However you are, he will embrace you. He is ready to share. You only have to share from your side.</P>

    <P>Some karma can be changed and some cannot.</P>
    <P>When you prepare halwa, if sugar is less or ghee is less, water more or less, it can all be adjusted, repaired. But once soji is cooked, it cannot be reversed.</P>
    <P>If the buttermilk is sour, milk can be added, salt can be added to make it drinkable. But it can never be reversed back to milk.</P>
    <P>Prabdha karma cannot be changed. Sanchita karma can be changed by spiritual practices. Satsang burns the seed of all negative karma.</P>
    <P>When you praise someone, you take on their good karma. When you blame someone you take on their bad karma.</P>
    <P>Know this and surrender both good and bad karma to the Divine and be free.</P>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>ONLY SPEAK KNOWLEDGE</B></P>
<P>Only speak Knowledge. Don't repeat anything that someone tells you or opinions about anyone that someone states -- "That so-and-so said such-and-such about you." If someone comes to tell you such things, discourage them. Don't believe it. </P>
<P>If someone blames you directly, know that they are taking away your bad karma and let it go. Don't believe in it, and if you're one of the Guru's close ones, you will take all of the blame of the world with a smile. </P>
<P>Conflict is the nature of the world; comfort is the nature of the self. Amidst the conflict seek the comfort. </P>
<P>When you are bored with the comfort, get into the games of the world. When you are tired of the games of the world, get into the comforts of the Self. If you are one of the Guru's close ones, you do both simultaneously. Trying to end conflict prolongs it. Face the conflict by seeking the comfort of the Self. </P>
<P>God is alive in the world and has been putting up with all the ongoing conflicts throughout the ages. If God can put up with all the conflicts, you can too. The moment you agree to be with the conflict, the conflict disappears.</P>
<P>People who love peace do not want to fight, and those who fight do not love peace. Those who want peace want to run away. What is needed here is to be peaceful within and then fight. The whole message of the Gita is to be peaceful yourself and then fight. Krishna tells Arjuna to fight but be in peace at the same time. Does this ring a bell?</P>
<P>In the world, you resolve one conflict and another one comes up. For example, Russia is solved and then Bosnia arises. You make one better, and then another starts up. Your body gets a cold, then you get better; then your back hurts, then it gets better. Your body gets better, and then the mind goes. The world runs like this, isn't it?</P>
<P>Without any intention, misunderstandings happen. It's not up to you to try to resolve them. Ignore them and be alive.</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>MASTER IS A DOORWAY</B></P>
      <P>Master is a doorway. And the doorway needs to be more charming than the world so that you will come to the doorway. Someone is in the street and there is rain, thunder, hot sun; they need shelter. They look around, they find a doorway. They come to the doorway. The doorway is more inviting, more charming, more celebrative, more joyful than anything else in the world.</P>
      <P>Nothing could give that much peace, joy, pleasure in the world. Once you come to the doorway, you enter the door and see the world from there. See the world from the eyes of the Master. This is a sign that you have come to the Master. Otherwise you may still be standing in the street and looking at the door. </P>
      <P>But once you have entered the door, then you will see the whole world from the eyes of the Master. This means what? In every situation that you face, you will think, "If this situation comes in front of the Master, how would he handle it?" or "How would she handle it?" "If this complication comes in front of the Master, how would he take it?" "If someone blames the Master like this, how would he handle it?" See the world from the eyes of the Master all the time.</P>
      <P>The world looks much more beautiful; not a nasty place. But a place filled with love, filled with joy, cooperation, compassion, and all virtues. The world is much more fun. Looking through the doorway, there is no fear. You will look at the world without any fear. You will be in all relationships with everybody without any fear. Because there is shelter. </P>
      <P>From inside home, you will look at the thunder, you will look at the storm, you will look at the rain, you will look at the bright sun. Inside you have air conditioning. Very cool, pleasant. Outside it's hot. You donÒ´ mind because there is nothing that can really distract you, disturb you, or take the fullness away from you. Such a sense of security, such a sense of fullness and joy comes. That is the purpose of having a Master.</P>
      <P>All relationships in the world go topsy-turvy. You make relationships and you break relationships. All relationships can get broken or made up and again broken. And there is craving and aversion. This is the world. This is samsara.</P>
      <P>But the Master is not a relationship. The Master is the Presence. What is necessary is to feel the Presence of the Master, not to make a relationship. Don't make the Master a part of your world. Then the same, "Oh, he looked at me." "He didn't look at me." "Oh, he said this." "He didn't say that." "Oh, somebody is close. I am not close." All this garbage comes into it. You feel the Presence of the Master, that is eternal. That has been there with you before, now, and will be there in the future, too.</P>
      <P>Master is the Presence. World is relativity. And relativity has limitations. Presence is unlimited. Presence is vast, infinite, and all comprehensive, all inclusive. And the presence of the Master in one's life will bring fulfillment to all relations. Every relationship will become complete with the presence of the Infinity if the Master is in your life. </P>

Accepting it either as black or as white. Put it either as black and accept it or as white and accept it -- whether or not it is black or white. And see the gray as a shade of black or white. Either way you accept it. Honest or dishonest -- accept it. Then the mind is quiet. You are not in the gray area.</P>
      <P>See, the eyes are dark, eyebrows are dark, the thymus -- the most powerful organ of the body -- is black. Hemoglobin -- the main force of the body -- is black. You cannot survive without black. It is part of you.</P>
      <P>Or see it as white. Eye is also white. Bones are white; the structure on which the whole body stands is white. Put it in a category of black -- no problem -- accept. Put it in a category of white -- no problem -- doubt is not there. Have conviction. "I accept. They are dishonest and still part of me." That's it. Finished.</P>
      <P>Doubt is wanting to get rid of something. Doubt is a temporary state. Neither up nor below. There tension arises.</P>

        <P>&nbsp;Celebration happens around the bonfire. Grief happens around the fire of cremation. The same fire that supports life in winter, can also destroy. One fire, like a ghee lamp, lights your way and purifies. Another fire made of toxic material creates pollution. </P>
        <P>&nbsp;You are also like fire. Are you the fire that creates smoke and pollution or the flame of camphor which creates light and fragrance? A saint is like a camphor flame that creates light and the fragrance of love. He is the friend of life.</P>
        <P>&nbsp;The fire that creates light and warmth and is useful is of higher quality. The fire that creates light and a little smoke as well is of medium quality. The fire that creates darkness and only smoke is of low quality. Learn to distinguish the different fires. If your senses are engaged in goodness, then you will create light and fragrance. If engaged in impurity, you create smoke and darkness. It is <I>samyama</I> that transforms the quality of fire in you. Next week we will discuss <I>samyama</I>. </P>

            <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>HABITS AND VOWS</B></P>
          </B><P>&nbsp;How to get rid of <I>vasanas</I> (impressions)? This is a question for all those who want to come out of habits. </P>
          <P>&nbsp;You want to get rid of habits because they give pain and restrict you. The nature of <I>vasana</I> is to bother you, or bind you, and wanting to be free is the nature of life. Life wants to be free and when a soul doesn't know how to be free, it wanders through lifetimes wanting freedom.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;The way to come out of habits is vows. This is <I>samyama</I>. Everybody is endowed with a little <I>samyama</I>. </P>
          <P>&nbsp;A vow should be time bound. This would bring good conduct and save you from being wayward. Consider the time and place for vows to be taken.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;When the mind dwells on useless thoughts, then two things happen. One is that all those old patterns come up and you feel discouraged by them. You blame yourself and feel that you have not made any progress. </P>
          <P>&nbsp;The second thing is that you see it as an opportunity for <I>samyama</I> and feel happy about it. Without <I>samyama,</I> life will not be happy and diseases arise. For example, you know you should not eat three servings of ice cream, or eat ice cream every day, or otherwise you will get sick.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;Habits will clog you when there is no liveliness or juice in life. When there is a direction for life force, you can rise above habits through <I>samyama.</P>
          </I><P>&nbsp;Take vows according to time and place. For example, suppose someone has a habit of smoking cigarettes and says, "I will quit smoking," but cannot do it. They can take a vow, three months or 90 days; a time-bound vow. If someone is used to cursing and swearing, take a vow not to use bad language for ten days. Don't take it for a lifetime; you will break it immediately. If you happen to break it in between, don't worry. Just begin again. Slowly increase the duration until it becomes your nature.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;All those habits which bother you, bind them in vows, in <I>samyama</I>. So all those who are in Satsang, take a time-bound vow today and make a note of it. If you break a vow, make a note of it and share the time and date at the next Satsang. Continue it again. Tie those habits which bring you pain in <I>samyama</I>.</P>

              <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>DEALING WITH BLAME</B></P>
            </B><P>&nbsp;How to get rid of <I>vasanas</I> (impressions)? This is a question for all those who want to come out of habits. </P>
          </B><P>&nbsp;When someone blames you, what do you usually do? Blame them back or you put up resistance in yourself. When someone blames you, they actually take away some negative karma from you. If you understand this and don't put up resistance and feel happy about it, then you drop your resistance. "Oh, good. That person is blaming me. Good. Something is going away." And when you drop the resistance, your karma goes away. Do you see what I'm saying? </P>
          <P>&nbsp;So when someone blames you and you put up resistance in your mind, and you don't react, then you are not allowing them to take the negative karma. Outside you may resist, but inside if you don't resist, and feel happy, "Oh, good, somebody is there to blame me and take some negative karma," you will feel immediately lighter.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;How does it feel to you when someone blames you? Do you feel some heaviness? Usually, when someone blames you, you feel hurt and you feel unhappy, you feel sad. This is all because you're . . . resisting. That is it. What you resist, persists. The ignorant person tells someone, "Don't blame me because it hurts me."</P>
          <P>&nbsp;An enlightened person also says "Don't blame me." Do you know why? Because it might hurt you. This is a beautiful point. What are the points? You get hurt because you resist the blame. When someone blames you, you resist it inside. Outside you may not resist, but inside when you resist, then that hurts you.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;An ignorant person warns you, "You better not hurt me, you better not blame me because I will feel hurt." Someone warns you not to blame them because it will hurt them and they'll do something harmful to you out of revenge.</P>
          <P>&nbsp;An enlightened person says "Don't blame me because it will hurt you." So here you say, don't blame because of compassion. You can tell someone, don't blame me out of compassion, or you can say it out of anger.</P>

          <P>&nbsp;Guruji arrived in Poland for an enchanting course with nearly 400 people. Every eye was filled with tears of gratitude. Then Guruji was off to Braunlage in Germany where more than 200 people had come together to celebrate the silence.</P>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>TODAY IS KRISHNA'S BIRTHDAY</B></P>
    <P ALIGN="CENTER">&#9;&#9;BIRTH OF THE CENTER OF ATTRACTION</P>
  </B><P>&nbsp;Krishna means the most attractive . . . It is the divinity that is the most attractive; the energy that pulls everything to it. Krishna is the formless center which is everywhere. Any attraction from anywhere is coming only from Krishna. Often people fail to see the spirit behind the attraction and merely hold on to the outer shell. And the moment you try to possess the shell, you will see Krishna has played a trick and you will be left with an empty shell in your hands and tears in your eyes.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;Be clever like Radha -- don't be tricked by Krishna. Krishna could not escape from Radha, for her whole world was filled with Krishna. If you can see that wherever there is an attraction, there is Krishna; then you are Radha, you are in your center.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;The mind moves towards beauty, joy and truth. Krishna tells Arjuna, "I am the beauty in the Beautiful, the strength in the Strong, the wisdom in the Wise." In this way he arrests the mind from moving away from him.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;Krishna reveals this Knowledge to Arjuna because he is <I>Anasuya</I>. Next week we will see what is <I>Anasuya</I>.</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>ANASUYA</B></P>
    </B><P>&nbsp;Knowledge will be different at different levels of consciousness. At a particular level of consciousness you will become <I>anasuya</I>. <I>Anasuya</I> is devoid of fault-finding eyes. If a mirror is dusty, you need a duster to clean it. But if your eyes have a cataract, any amount of dusting will not help. So first you have to remove the cataract. Then you can see that the mirror is already clean.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;There is a certain mind set that always finds fault, even in the best conditions in the world. When you give a person with this mind set the best, they still find faults. Even with the best possible companion, or the most beautiful painting, they will still find something wrong. That kind of mind set cannot know the sacred Knowledge. Krishna tells Arjuna that he is giving him the Royal Secret, because he is <I>anasuya</I>. "You are not finding fault in Me, even though you are so close."</P>
    <P>&nbsp;From a distance, even craters cannot be seen. Even on a smooth surface there will be holes. If you are only interested in the holes, you will not see the magnanimity of things. If you are not in <I>anasuya</I>, Knowledge cannot blossom in you. Then there is no point in giving Knowledge. </P>
    <P>&nbsp;Question: What about discrimination -- Wisdom?</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Answer: If it is in your vision, your vision will find discrimination. The moment you are out of the path, everything is all wrong, that is not <I>anasuya</I>. For example, you have a friendship, and after 10 years you decide to leave. When you leave, you do not see the good in that relationship. You find fault. This is not <I>anasuya</I>.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;However, once you discover you have the wrong vision, half of the wrong vision has already disappeared. There is a fine line here. There cannot be any better example than the cataract. Instead of saying, "My vision is blurred," you say, "The whole world is not sharp." Suppose someone is coming in. It is windy, so you shut the door. But the person thinks the door has been slammed in his face! This is <I>asuya</I>. It is not <I>anasuya</I>. Most of the population is like this.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;<I>Asuya</I> is finding fault. It is seeing malicious intent everywhere. It is like a child who says, "Mother, you don't love me!" The child's vision is wrong. If the mother does not love the child, who will? It is the same as if someone comes and says, "Guruji, you don't love me!" If I don't love them, forget about it. Nobody else in the world will! Where else will they find love? Nowhere. A mother may get frustrated but not a Master.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Question: It seems as though you can't have <I>anasuya</I> unless you are enlightened?</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Answer: Not always. This is an excuse. To get enlightenment, you must have this vision.</P>

        <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>THE LOVE OF THE IGNORANT AND THE ANGER OF THE ENLIGHTENED</B></P>
      </B><P>&nbsp;The love of the ignorant can be harmful yet even the anger of the Enlightened is not harmful. It can be only good!</P>
      <P>&nbsp;An example is the school at the Art of Living Ashram in Bangalore. 250 children are enrolled but only 200 come to class on any given day. Fifty children don't show up. Why? They cry at home, "Mother, I don't want to go to school."</P>
      <P>&nbsp;The mother says, "Oh, la la, don't cry . . . ok." She thinks, "No child in the world is like my child." And so she sticks up for the child and begins to speak for him. She does not see the teacher's point of view. The mother asks the teacher, "Why are you not teaching my child properly? He is so innocent, so lovely." So, what happens -- the child grows up spoiled. The love in the mother's ignorance has spoiled the child. The child will never learn the alphabet, never learn to read or write, but the mother says, "Oh, never mind, there are sheep to look after and fields to tend." The mother's love in ignorance has spoiled the child.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;The anger of the Enlightened is a blessing. There are many instances of this in the <I>Puranas</I>. Once a Master was traveling in the middle province of India with a disciple following him a few yards behind. Some boys who were rude, rough, and abusive began to throw stones and tease the disciple calling him names. This went on for some time as the boys followed the Master and the disciple. They came to a river. The Master and the disciple got into a boat in order to cross. The boys got in another boat which started to sink in the middle of the river.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;The Master slapped the disciple across the face. The disciple was so surprised as he had not said a word back to the boys in response to their taunts. He had been such a good disciple and yet the Master had slapped him!</P>
      <P>&nbsp;The Master said, "It is your fault. You are responsible for their boat sinking. You did not respond to their abuse. Nature has now punished them in a worse way because you did not have enough compassion to quell their insults."</P>
      <P>&nbsp;The slap that the Master gave took away the karma of this event such that it would not be carried into the future of the boys. It also served to take away any little bit of joy the disciple may have felt at seeing the boys' boat sink! Thus, it also took away the karma of the event for the disciple. So, the anger of the Enlightened is a blessing!</P>

So . . . you can never know a good liar. The person you call a liar is not a good liar and they are innocent. Aren't they?</P>

  </B><P>&nbsp;Like fish in the water, you are in air. Thoughts are in mind. Mind is in Big Mind. The Big Mind in Me is love. Emotions are ripples in love. Love is all Knowledge.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;Every atom of Big Mind is crammed with Knowledge. Knowing this, you stop seeking. You seek until you come to the Master. You walk until you come to the swimming pool. You don't walk or run in the swimming pool -- you swim or float. Once you come to the Master, seeking stops, blossoming begins.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;You are Knowledge. Every atom in you is shimmering with Knowledge. This is called <I>Go</I>. Be a <I>Go-Pal</I>. Be a friend in Knowledge.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;<I>Go</I> has four meanings:</P>

  <P>&#9;Movement</P>
  <P>&#9;Achievement</P>
  <P>&#9;Freedom or liberation</P></DIR>

  <P>Often you become friends by:</P>

  <P>&#9;Gossiping about negative things</P>
  <P>&#9;Complaining</P>
  <P>&#9;Similar cravings or aversions</P>
  <P>&#9;Common enemies or common problems</P>
  <P>&#9;Common goals or common addictions</P></DIR>
  
  <P>Coming together in Knowledge is rare. You become friends because you have something in common. Be a friend in Knowledge. Uplift each other in Knowledge. All Satsangees are <I>Gopals</I> -- reminding each other, coming together in and for Knowledge. That is <I>Gopal</I>. Be a protector of this Knowledge.</P>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>FREEDOM AND DISCIPLINE</B></P>
  </B><P>Freedom and discipline are opposites and complementary. The purpose of defense is to protect freedom. But is there freedom in defense? Do soldiers have freedom? No, they are totally bound, not even allowed to put the right foot down when told the left foot. Their steps are measured and they are unable even to walk with a natural rhythm. There is total lack of freedom in defense. That which has absolutely no freedom is protecting the freedom of the country! So it is with the police; they protect the freedom of the individual. But are they free?</P>
  <P>Discipline protects freedom. They both go hand in hand. Understand this and go ahead in life. You have some restrictions and it is this that allows you freedom. You can choose to focus either on freedom or discipline, and this makes you happy or unhappy. Freedom without discipline is like a country without a defense.</P>
  <P>Fences should be fences; a fence cannot be built all over the property. If your fence is all over, how can you build on the property? That state of high absolute freedom is too difficult; we need to be very practical. Yes, there is a state of unlimited bliss, the freedom Advaita talks about. The Advaita Knowledge has been totally misused or used according to one's own fancies and conveniences.</P>
  <P>There must be awareness in the mind, love in the heart, and righteousness in action.</P>
  <P>Love and fear are two possibilities that put you on track. The Jewish religion put fear as the main thing so that life could improve. Nature induces fear at a certain age in a child. When a child is very young, it gets 100 percent time and love of the mother. The child has no fear. As the child grows more independent it becomes cautious. Nature brings in an iota of fear. With freedom, the child starts walking carefully. Fear of losing freedom also brings defense. The purpose of defense is to eliminate fear.</P>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>On this path Knowledge is your Freedom<BR>and also your Defense.</B></P>

  <P>&nbsp;There are three things: the Self, the senses, and the object, or the world. And there are three words: <I>sukha</I>, pleasure; <I>dukha</I>, sorrow; and <I>sakha</I>, companion. These have one thing in common: "kha," which means "senses."</P>
  <P>&nbsp;The Self through the senses experiences the world. When the senses are with the Self, that is pleasure (<I>sukha</I>), because the Self is the source of all joy or pleasure. When the senses are away from the Self (<I>dukha</I>) -- in the mud, lost in the object -- that is misery. Mud, misery, mind -- they are very close.</P>
  </FONT><FONT FACE="BernhardMod BT" SIZE=5><P>Self &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senses ("Kha")&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; World</P>
  <P>---&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy (Sukha)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorrow (Dukha)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--- </P>
  </FONT><FONT FACE="BernhardMod BT"><P>Self is the nature of joy. In any pleasant experience, you close your eyes; you smell a nice flower, or you taste or touch something. So<I> sukha</I> is that which takes you to the Self. <I>Dukha</I> is that which takes you away from the Self. Sorrow simply means that you are caught up in the object, which goes on changing, instead of focussing on the Self.</P>
  <P>All the sense objects are just a diving board to take you back to the Self.</P>
  <I><P>Sa-kha</I>, companion, means: "He <B><I>is</B></I> the senses." <I>Sakha</I> is one who has become your senses, who is your senses. If you are my senses, it means I get Knowledge through you; you are my sixth sense. As I trust my mind, so I trust you. A friend could be just an object of the senses, but a <I>sakha</I> has become the very senses.</P>
  <P>The <I>sakha</I> is the companion who is there in both the experiences of the <I>dukha</I> and of <I>sukha</I>. It means one who leads you back to the Self. If you are stuck in an object, that wisdom which pulls you back to the Self is <I>sakha</I>.</P>
  <P>Knowledge is your companion and your companion is Knowledge. And the Master is nothing but the embodiment of Knowledge. So<I> sakha</I> means, "He is my senses, I see the world through that wisdom, through Him."</P>
  <P>If your sense is the Divine, then you see the whole world through the Divinity.</P>

      <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>SCEPTICISM</B></P>
      
      <P>&nbsp;Ignorance is being a sceptic and not knowing you are a sceptic. If you think you are a sceptic, you are no longer a sceptic because you have a clue of something beyond. So, in reality, you can never know whether you are a sceptic or not!</P>
      <P>&nbsp;A sceptic is stuck in a paradigm and closes all other possibilities. But this creation is of all possibilities. As one understands the paradigm shift, scepticism is removed.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;A real scientist can never afford to be a sceptic because scepticism closes down possibilities and does not continue to probe into unknown areas of existence. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;In short, scepticism is an "I know it all" attitude, and this attitude is unscientific. Scepticism is dispelled by Knowledge. Perception and inference are two means of knowing.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;In every human being deep inside, there is faith and love. What you think is scepticism is only a thin layer. If you hold in your mind that they are sceptics you empower their scepticism. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;Do not recognize someone's scepticism and try to argue with them. Argument strengthens their scepticism. Fear of interference in one's freedom brings more resistance and causes scepticism.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;Your silence and the smile from your heart will dispel their scepticism. There is nothing better than silence to break scepticism. Silence means the quality of consciousness, not just keeping lips tight.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;Scepticism doesn't come up in children. It comes only with people who walk with boundaries. Children have no scepticism. They live in their fantasy world, a world of many possibilities. Their world is one of innocence, joy, beauty, and so much love.</P>

        <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>SHAUCHA AND ASHAUCHA</B></P>
        
        <P>&nbsp;When you are miserable, what has happened is that you have gone away from the Self. This is called <I>Ashaucha</I>. It means you have become unclean.</P>
<P>&nbsp;In India when someone dies, the close relatives are said to be <I>Ashaucha</I> for 10 days because they are very sad. They are impure because they have moved away from the self. After 10 days of just being with that experience and reading the Gita, being with the Knowledge and pulling themselves back into the Self, then it is called <I>Shaucha</I>. They have purged out the impurities that have come during events.</P>
<P>&nbsp;This keeps happening again and again in dealings in life. You become <I>Ashaucha</I> and you have to get back to<I> Shaucha</I>. Go deeper in to yourself, then real <I>Shaucha</I> happens.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<I>Shaucha's</I> benefits are clarity in the intellect, a pleasing mind, focused awareness in the mind, a say over the senses, and therefore eligibility to realize the Self.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<I>Shaucha</I> is disinterestedness in the tendencies of one's own senses and non-association with other people. If a tendency in your body arises just have the understanding, "Oh yes, here is this old familiar tendency coming up again. Come on, you have had this experience enough, and still the body is craving for it again." Disinterestedness in one's own body -- just an idea, a sort of distaste, and in one moment it changes.</P>
<P>Why do people love each other so much, have such an intimate relationship, and then fight? <I>Ashaucha</I> has happened. If you don't get distaste for the tendency of the senses then distaste for the object of the senses will come and you will blame the object.</P>
<P>&nbsp;When <I>Ashaucha</I> happens then come back to <I>Shaucha</I> quickly. Suppose you get drowned in any worldly aspect, just know this is <I>Ashaucha</I> . . . "That is why I am suffering misery." Then come back to <I>Shaucha</I>.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Your attraction or craving is only as long as you think someone is "other." When you think they are part of you or your Self, then the attraction dies out. That is why a husband or wife is not attracted to the partner but to someone else because the partner has already become a part of them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;When you realize everyone is part of your Self, you enjoy the whole world without a sense of craving.</P>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>BOREDOM AND SADHANA</B></P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;What is boredom? </P>
<P>&nbsp;A repetition without interest or love causes a monotonous state of mind; that is boredom. It overshadows the Self. </P>
<P>&nbsp;A practice or <I>abhyasa</I> is again a repetition whose purpose is to destroy the boredom and reunite with the Self. In this process the practice itself creates boredom and as you continue, it penetrates the boredom and destroys it once and for all. Whether the practice gives you joy or boredom, it must be continued. Only the practice or <I>abhyasa</I> can annihilate the Mind.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Self is Love and Love is always repetitive. That is why love letters are simply repetitive and there is no boredom there. If you are bored with yourself then how much more boring you would be for others. Root out the boredom in you through deep and continued meditation.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Wake up and Walk up.</P>

    <P>&nbsp;There are three forces: <I>Brahma shakti, Vishnu shakti, </I>and <I>Shiva shakti</I>. You may have one of these predominant. <I>Brahma shakti</I> is the force to create something new. <I>Vishnu shakti</I> is maintenance and <I>Shiva shakti</I> is bringing in transformation, filling in life, or destroying.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Some of you have <I>Brahma shakti</I>. You may create well, but you may not be able to maintain. For example, you may make friends very fast, but it does not last long. </P>
<P>&nbsp;There are others who cannot create but are good at maintaining. For example, people have long lasting friendships but cannot make any new friends. In such cases, <I>Vishnu shakti</I> is dominant. </P>
<P>&nbsp;And then there are others who have more of <I>Shiva shakti</I>. They bring in new life or transformation or they can destroy the whole set up.</P>
<P>&nbsp;In <I>Guru shakti</I>, all three <I>shaktis</I> have blossomed fully. </P>
<P>&nbsp;So each of you first identify which <I>shakti</I> you have more of and aspire for <I>Guru shakti</I>. Guru makes a group but a group cannot make a Guru.</P>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>HOW TO MAINTAIN INTIMACY</B></P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;Intimacy often gets broken because of ego or your desire. What breaks intimacy?</P>

    <DIR>
    
    <P>&#9;Ego or taking a position</P>
    <P>&#9;Desire</P>
    <P>&#9;Taking intimacy for granted</P>
    <P>&#9;Finding imperfection in oneself or others</P>
    <P>&#9;Expectations</P>
    <P>&#9;Insensitivity or over sensitivity</P>
    <P>&#9;Lack of vivek or vairagya (lack of discretion or dispassion)</P>
    <P>&#9;Judgements</P>
    <P>&#9;Grumbling or lack of gratitude</P></DIR>
    
    
    <P>Dissolving into infinity is the way to maintain intimacy. Intimacy is dissolving into infinity. Dissolving into infinity brings you to the moment. Go beyond events. Dissolve into infinity, be in the moment, and look beyond the events. This is the way to maintain intimacy.</P>
    <P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * </P>
    <P>If you attend Satsang you don't get much; but if you don't, you lose a lot. Just to maintain where you are, what you are, you need to attend weekly Satsang. </P>
    <P>&nbsp;Now, start doing ten minutes of Satsang, sharing of the Knowledge with someone, anyone. You are so used to talking gossip. Now for two weeks, talk Knowledge, especially to those not coming to Satsang. Even on the phone -- suppose you can't find someone at seven o'clock; call someone on the phone and talk Knowledge for a couple of minutes: "What are you doing? What do you want? How can I help you?" Praise the Divine.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;This is an exercise. Every day for ten minutes, do individual Satsang and skillfully talk ten minutes of Knowledge. Say, "Everything is temporary, everything is changing." Speak some Knowledge on the changing nature of the world.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Guruji was on the porch with a group of people. He sent Kashi to get the sweets from inside the kuti, but Kashi returned saying he could not find them. He went again and again, three times, and still he could not find them. Then Guruji himself went in. He came out with the sweets and gave them to everyone.</P>
<P>&nbsp;This is exactly what happens in life. Many want sweetness in life. Some are searching hard, but only one finds it. And when that one finds it, he gives it to everyone.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Everyone is blissed in and some are blissed out, too!</P>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>OVERCOMING EVENTS</B></P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;All the problems that you face in life are because you attach over importance to the events. The events grow bigger while you remain smaller. Say, for example, you are riding a motorbike on a busy motor way and in front of you there is another vehicle emitting exhaust fumes. You have three options.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1. &#9;You can complain, somehow bear with it, and still follow the vehicle.</P>
<P>2. &#9;You can slow down or wait for some time to allow the vehicle to move far away from you.</P>
<P>3. &#9;You can use your skill, overtake the vehicle, and forget about it.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>As in the first case, most of you stick on the events and are miserable, like inhaling fumes throughout your journey.</P>
<P>In the second case, you don't get permanent relief, as another bigger vehicle might come in front of you. Like that, running away from events is not the permanent solution.</P>
<P>However, wise people use their skill and grow over the events. If the vehicle is in perfect condition, the skill is effective. Conditioning the vehicle is <I>sadhana</I> or practice. And skill is the grace of the Guru.</P>
<P>The mistakes that you have made in the past have made you humble; you need not make mistakes in the future to become humble.</P>

      <P>&nbsp;Pure water is like love, Knowledge is like detergent, mind is like cloth, and the body like the washing machine. If you put in mud instead of detergent, your clothes become dirtier than before.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;You will have to go on putting clothes in the washing machine to get them cleaned. And the process repeats again and again. Similarly you will have many more births until you stop repeating the mistakes that you have made.</P>

<P>&nbsp;Review the year while you celebrate. This is your homework. What did you do? What did you achieve? How useful were you this past year?

<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">SPREADING THE FRAGRANCE</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;During Satsang, Guruji opened a small nicely-wrapped present. It was a tiny bottle of jasmine perfume. He twisted off the cap and sniffed the lovely fragrance. Then he proceeded to pour a small amount on some paper which he waved in the air, wafting the scent to all corners of the hall. Everyone could then enjoy it.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Guruji explained that it is not enough simply to have the fragrance. We have to know how to spread it. Flowers have the fragrance, but it is the wind that comes and spreads it. In the same way, each one of us is wonderful within -- we are beautiful, caring, and loving. But we do not know how to spread the fragrance.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Satsang is that wind which comes and spreads this fragrance to everyone.</P>

      <P>&nbsp;<B>NEWS FLASH</P>
      </B><P>&nbsp;Guruji arrived for the first time on January 15th in the Croatian capital of Zagreb. As soon as we landed, Guruji was driven straight to one of the largest concert halls in Zagreb. Guruji first met with a group of over a hundred professionals including doctors and members of the press. A few hours later the hall was filled to capacity for his evening lecture. The national television station filmed the entire talk. Over 100 people waited outside unable to enter. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;Before addressing the large crowd Guruji went out to the lobby and greeted those who could not enter. His talk was exquisite and a soft feeling of grace and peace transformed the atmosphere. At the end of the lecture many still waited outside for over two hours to get a glimpse of Guruji.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;The next evening Guruji gave his first talk in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Hundreds crowded into the World Trade Center. Guruji was soon overloaded with flowers from the group. Guruji continued to talk for an hour and a half as the enthusiastic crowd would not let him finish. The atmosphere was charged with immense gratitude and celebration. The Art of Living groups in Croatia and Slovenia have done an excellent job.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;Guruji now flies off to New York for a television interview and then it's on to the advanced course in Hawaii!</P>

    <P>&nbsp;What type of time do you give the Divine? Usually you give the time that is leftover, when you have nothing else to do, when no guests are coming, there are no parties to go to, no nice movies to watch, no weddings to attend. Such time you give. This is not quality time. </P>
<P>&nbsp;Give quality time to the Divine. It will be rewarded. If your prayers are not answered it is because you have never given quality time. Give Satsang and meditation your highest priority. Give prime time to the Divine. You definitely will be rewarded.</P>

Guruji has brought out deep Knowledge from the most mundane questions. We are making efforts to bring these tapes to you soon.</P>

<DIR>

<P>1.&#9;Compliments? . . . no.</P>
<P>2.&#9;Blame? . . . no, people take blame.</P>

<P>4.&#9;Happiness? . . . nobody can give happiness.</P>
<P>5. &#9;??</P></DIR>

<P>The clue is that it hangs in space like an orphan. No one owns it. Like an overripe papaya in Hawaii, it rots.</P>

  <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SPOT IN THE UNIVERSE</B></P>
  
  <P>&nbsp;There is a place you can come where everything is beautiful. Tourists go from place to place looking for beauty. They try to take beauty from that place. They only get tired and tanned. Yet the most beautiful spot anywhere is right here. When you come here, you find that wherever you are, everything is so beautiful.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Where is this place? Don't look here and there. Where do you go? Within you. When you come here, then any place is beautiful. Then wherever you go, you add beauty there.</P>
<P>&nbsp;If you are unhappy, even the moon is irritating to you. Sweet things are nauseating, music is disturbing. When you are calm and centered inside, noise is musical, clouds are magical, rain is liquid sunshine.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Book yourself on a trip to this most beautiful place in the universe. Then you find that every day is a vacation and a celebration.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;P.S. The answer to last weekÒ³ riddle is "advice." Advice hangs in the space, the giver goes on giving, the taker never takes. It goes on and on.</P>

  		<P>&nbsp;<B>And now the NEWS splash from the surf</B>: </P>
<P>&nbsp;A lady was driving along the coast of Kauai and just started singing our Bhajans which she had never heard before. Later she found herself at our Satsang.</P>
<P>&nbsp;A Hawaiian Princess, Owana, found herself wondering why she felt compelled to drive in circles around a hotel in Honolulu. Later she found out from a devotee that it was Guruji's hotel. The next night she was singing her deeply felt native Hawaiian songs at Punditji's feet.</P>
<P>&nbsp;On Sunday, a lady named Mary was spending the day at an ancient temple ruins. She had gone there to make an offering and to pray. Her prayer was to meet her spiritual teacher and be shown the way Home. On Monday, she met Punditji and instantly became devoted. </P>

</B><P>&nbsp;Question: God is all abundant, all full and we are connected to God. Then why are we in debt, except for some? Why do they have, and we don't have?</P>
<P>&nbsp;Guruji: Is it only money? You have abundance, yet at the same time, you are indebted. So how can both be true? How can you be indebted and at the same time have abundance?</P>
<P>&nbsp;Somebody says: An abundance of indebtedness!</P>
<P>&nbsp;Guruji: When you say you are indebted, that means you have received. Otherwise how can you be indebted? So be thankful for being indebted, because you have received. Those who have received should feel indebted. If you don't feel indebted, you cannot have abundance. So the more indebted you feel, the more abundance you have.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Question: When the disciples met Jesus, they were not very successful, did not catch very many fish. When they met Jesus, he told them exactly where to fish and that's when they got lots of fish and then they decided to follow Jesus. </P>
<P>&nbsp;(Laughter)</P>
<P>&nbsp;Guruji: Feel indebted. Feel gratitude. Then abundance comes. As long as you are wanting for abundance you get indebted. Feel indebtedness and gratitude, then abundance comes.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Abundance and indebtedness coexist. You think you are indebted, but you really are not. It is better to feel totally indebted, because every bit of what you have, doesn't belong to you, including your body. Then you are infinitely indebted for your body, for Knowledge, for things you have received, and for your own life. Then you bask in the abundance of the Creator.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Someone says: I feel very indebted. Thank you!</P>

  		<P>&nbsp;<B>NEWS FLASH</B>: </P>
<P>&nbsp;Physicians of Apple Valley had organized memorable meetings and Satsangs. Guruji was on CNN News. Guruji was in the media and newspapers for several days before the much awaited event. Local TV stations were announcing the event every hour. </P>
<P>&nbsp;From there -- unbelievable Satsangs in packed halls in Los Angeles. The drummers and Divya got everyone on their feet. The atmosphere was electrifying. </P>
<P>&nbsp;Guruji went to the University of Northeast Missouri that had sponsored his visit. Students and Lloyd had organized 700 people to welcome Guruji.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Guruji, not only in spirit, but also physically, piloted a twin engine Cessna plane back to St. Louis, Missouri on his way to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The church was filled with devotion and decorations. The way Guruji looked -- the Grace and Knowledge were so magical -- the scene is impossible to describe. The hurricane of<I> Satva </I>has moved on to Miami. </P>

  		<P>&nbsp;<B>NEWS FLASH</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;Just a week before Guruji's arrival, Raj woke up in the middle of the night in Loughborough. He thought that some light was coming from the clock. He looked at Guruji's picture and saw that light was coming from it. This light grew and filled the room. He made sure that there was no outside light left on. The divine light stayed on for about ten minutes.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Upholland, Lancashire held an advanced course in Guruji's presence.</P>
<P>Guruji gave a talk on Ayurveda and the Art of Living at the Liverpool Medical Institution. The hall was full to capacity with standing room only, attended by medical professionals. It was a brilliant talk, but Punditji did not think so! He thought it was very mundane! There was great enthusiasm, however.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Next, Guruji's entourage moved with luggage and cars at its own speed and proceeded to Stourbridge in the Midlands for a talk organized by Stourbridge Earth Mysteries. The talk was simply great! The entourage then moved on to London, arriving at 3 o' clock in the morning for "The UK Tired of Living Teacher's Meeting" with baggage, blankets, pillows, plastic bags, pots and pans, and the usual divine chaos!!</P>

    <P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>KNOWLEDGE AND FAITH</B></P>
    
    <P>&nbsp;In science you have knowledge first, and then faith follows.</P>
<P>In spirituality, faith comes first, and then Knowledge follows.</P>
<P>For example, the knowledge that pesticides and chemical fertilizers are good for plants came through science, and people had faith in it, and all over the world they were used. And then another knowledge came that they were not good and the faith shifted to organic farming. The same with antibiotics. </P>
<P>The knowledge brought faith, the knowledge changed, and then faith changed. The knowledge and faith of science is of "happening." In spirituality, faith is first and Knowledge comes later. Like Kriya, Yoga, and meditation -- first you have faith and then Knowledge follows. For example, if you do pranayama faithfully then you get the Knowledge of the prana; if your do your meditation faithfully, the Knowledge of consciousness follows. Even an illiterate, through faith, attains deep Knowledge.</P>
<P>Vinod: Human is the best composite material. (Laughter -- this is the NASA scientist mind.)</P>
<P>Punditji: Science considers even human as matter, and spirituality considers even earth as mother, even rivers and mountains as living beings.</P>
<P>Science regards life as matter and spirituality regards even matter as life.</P> 		</font>

  		<B><P>NEWS FLASH</B>:</P>
<P><I>Shivaratri</I> was celebrated in London as well as in the German Ashram. Devotees had put their hearts and souls to make the place so beautiful. The puja and Satsang transported everyone to another plane. As usual, laughter filled the corridors of the new Ashram. The big hall was already too small to the surprise of everyone! Our own spring water replaced Pepsi and Coke!</P>
<P>Then on to Copenhagen -- the capital of Denmark. It was a media event: people from TV, radio, and the newspaper were queuing into the hotel. The TV crew followed to the public talks which were packed and very lively.</P>
<P>Then the giggling gang moved on to Norway, but had left some luggage behind in the hotel. The flight was conveniently delayed, which was very unusual for SAS. Lakshmi had called Guruji the night before. Guruji had said we will arrive at the airport at exactly 12:15. It kept Lakshmi wondering and confused because it was almost one hour later than the original arrival time. And they all arrived on the dot at 12:15!</P>
<P>Wait for the exciting news from Norway and Sweden next week.</P>

      <P>&nbsp;Why do you respect someone? Because of their good qualities, isn't it? For example, positive qualities like honesty, wisdom, love, talents, behavior. But all these change in time. And when they do change, you lose respect. You only respect the greatness. </P>
<P>&nbsp;I have tremendous respect for each and every one. Not for their greatness or wisdom or talent, but for their very person. I respect everyone totally. So I can never lose respect for anybody, however they may be. One doesn't need to be great in order to be respected. Respecting the life makes you great. Don't look for respect from others; that makes you weak. Have respect for the self and no one can take your self-respect.</P>

    <P>&nbsp;From Norway and Sweden. Ingrid in her van, plastered with big posters of Guruji, caught the attention of the traffic. Posters were all over Oslo. Sheila made a poster war. </P>
    <P>&nbsp;Vinod and Ingrid turned a reluctant ambassador into an enthusiastic devotee, staying up all night reading the book "The Way of Grace."</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Adventure time: We all went to a ski simulator and then sledded three kilometers downhill. All the devotees tumbled down, all covered with snow and with frozen hands and feet. It was -10 C and everyone was wearing heavy winter clothes, but there was Guruji, sledding with sandals and shawl. He didn't get a speck of snow on Himself.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Stockholm, Sweden: A TV crew was waiting in the meditation hall to interview him. They asked him what he thought about the New Age, if the Art of Living was part of the New Age. A moment of silence passed and with a vivid smile he replied, "Age is always new."</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Another programme entitled "The Three Wise Men" was made with one of Sweden's most respected TV journalists for a major TV channel. The three wise men included Guruji and the Dalai Lama.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;Evening talks were filled with humor, brilliant questions were asked, and laughter filled the air. All the "hard nuts" started popping like popcorn. As usual, the best talks are never recorded.</P>

<P>Before Guruji arrived in Delhi, everything was meticulously planned and organized. When Guruji arrived, there was a spontaneous Satsang at the airport. Airport personnel and other passengers joined in. It was sparkling! The well-organized plans went haywire and the usual divine chaos followed. Everything was settled in a flash but the organizers were left holding the plans on paper!</P>
<P>There was an air of celebration at Saritha Vihar Satsang. The sweets and flowers made a carpet in the large hall that matched the fragrance of joy. At Karol Bagh, the next day, there was more than one reason for the authorities to raise their eyebrows -- stampede in the room, traffic jam on roads, and devotees forgetting their families in their eagerness to follow the "Gurumobile." Then on to Rishikesh and the teachers' refresher course. </P>
<P>Rishikesh. The lush green Himalayas all around -- in the front, the holy Ganges that roars, gurgles, and sometimes murmurs -- the sounds mingling with the chirping of the birds -- the call of the peacocks in the early morning -- the chiming of the temple bells at sunrise -- the chanting of Vedic hymns at all times. Dip in the cold waters -- everyone clad in shawls and sweaters on their way in -- and most reluctant to leave afterwards. Sitting with Guruji in the evening, watching the sunset. Electrifying Satsangs and discourses on Bhagwad Gita in Hindi by Guruji, transport everyone to a blissful, celestial experience. More about Rishikesh next week.</P>
